When comparing **Gravitee's JWT Plan** and **OAuth2 Plan**, it's important to understand their respective use cases, security models, and how they integrate into API management workflows. Below is a detailed comparison of the **Gravitee JWT Plan** and **OAuth2 Plan**, including their pros and cons.

---

## üîç Overview

### üìå JWT Plan (JSON Web Token)
- **Authentication Mechanism**: Token-based (stateless).
- **Use Case**: Validates a JWT token (e.g., issued by an external identity provider) to authenticate and authorize API requests.
- **Integration**: Works with external IdPs like Auth0, Okta, Keycloak, etc.
- **Validation**: Can validate signature, claims, and expiry.

### üìå OAuth2 Plan
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Uses OAuth2 flows (e.g., Authorization Code, Client Credentials).
- **Use Case**: Secure APIs using access tokens issued by an OAuth2 provider.
- **Integration**: Typically used with identity providers that support OAuth2 (like Google, Facebook, internal OAuth2 servers).
- **Token Type**: Usually Bearer tokens (not JWTs unless specified).

## ‚úÖ Pros and Cons

### üü¢ JWT Plan

#### ‚úÖ Pros:
| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Stateless** | No session tracking needed; easy to scale. |
| **Flexible** | Can be issued by any external Identity Provider (IdP). |
| **Custom Claims** | Can include custom claims for fine-grained authorization. |
| **Decentralized Validation** | Tokens can be validated without a round-trip to the IdP (if signed and public key is available). |
| **Easy to Implement** | If you already have a JWT system, integrating with Gravitee is straightforward. |

#### ‚ùå Cons:
| Limitation | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **No Revocation Support** | Once issued, tokens are valid until expiration (unless using a JTI + blacklist). |
| **No Expiry Control** | Tokens cannot be revoked early unless you implement additional logic. |
| **Security Risks** | If tokens are intercepted, they can be misused until expiry. |
| **No Token Refresh Mechanism** | Requires separate handling for refresh tokens or token rotation. |

### üü¢ OAuth2 Plan

#### ‚úÖ Pros:
| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Token Management** | Includes token expiration, refresh, and revocation. |
| **Secure by Design** | Follows industry-standard flows (e.g., PKCE, Authorization Code). |
| **Fine-Grained Access Control** | Scopes allow for granular permissions. |
| **Supports Multiple Flows** | Supports Client Credentials, Authorization Code, etc., for different client types. |
| **Centralized Control** | Tokens are issued and managed by an OAuth2 server. |

#### ‚ùå Cons:
| Limitation | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Requires OAuth2 Provider** | Needs an external OAuth2 server (e.g., Keycloak, Auth0). |
| **Stateful Behavior** | Some flows (like Authorization Code) may require session state. |
| **Complexity** | More complex to set up and manage compared to JWT. |
| **Latency** | Token introspection or revocation checks may add latency. |

## üß† When to Use Which?

| Use Case | Recommended Plan |
|----------|------------------|
| You already use JWTs for auth and want to validate them in Gravitee | JWT Plan |
| You want to enforce scopes and roles dynamically from the IdP | OAuth2 Plan |
| You need short-lived tokens with refresh capabilities | OAuth2 Plan |
| You need a lightweight, stateless authentication method | JWT Plan |
| You want to integrate with third-party identity providers (Google, Facebook, etc.) | OAuth2 Plan |
| You need to support mobile or web apps with PKCE | OAuth2 Plan |
| You're using microservices and want to pass tokens between them | JWT Plan (if signed and trusted) |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Considerations

| Feature | JWT Plan | OAuth2 Plan |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Token Type | JWT | Bearer (can be JWT or opaque) |
| Token Validation | Signature + Claims | Introspection or local validation |
| Token Revocation | Not supported natively | Supported |
| Token Expiry | Fixed at issuance | Can be refreshed |
| Integration | External IdP only | External OAuth2 server required |
| Custom Claims | Yes | Depends on OAuth2 provider |

---

## üìà Summary Table

| Criteria | JWT Plan | OAuth2 Plan |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Authentication** | Token-based (JWT) | Token-based (OAuth2) |
| **Authorization** | Based on claims in JWT | Based on scopes |
| **Revocation** | ‚ùå Difficult | ‚úÖ Supported |
| **Token Refresh** | ‚ùå Manual | ‚úÖ Built-in |
| **Integration Complexity** | Low | Medium-High |
| **Use Cases** | Microservices, APIs with existing JWTs | Web apps, mobile apps, secure APIs with scopes |
| **Scalability** | High (stateless) | Medium (depends on OAuth2 server) |

## üß© Bonus: JWT + OAuth2 Together?

In many enterprise setups, **JWT and OAuth2 are used together**:
- OAuth2 is used to obtain a JWT access token.
- Gravitee validates the JWT as part of the plan.
- This gives the benefits of both worlds: secure token issuance and stateless validation.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

| Plan | Best For | Recommendation |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **JWT Plan** | Stateless, lightweight token validation | Use when you already have JWTs and need simple validation |
| **OAuth2 Plan** | Secure token lifecycle with scopes | Use when you need full control over token issuance, scopes, and revocation |

Choose **JWT** if you want simplicity and already have a token system.  
Choose **OAuth2** if you need full control over token lifecycle and integration with secure identity providers.

Let me know if you want a sample configuration or flow for either plan!
