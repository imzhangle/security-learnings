Here's a detailed comparison between **Appdome** and **Build38** across the 14 security-related categories you've listed. Both platforms are focused on mobile application security, but they have different approaches and feature sets.

---

### üîê 1. **SSO (Single Sign-On)**
| Feature | Appdome | Build38 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| SSO Support | Yes ‚Äì via integration with identity providers like Okta, Azure AD, etc. | Yes ‚Äì supports SAML, OAuth2, OpenID Connect for SSO |
| Notes | Built-in SSO frameworks can be fused without coding. | SSO is part of their Secure Execution Environment (SEE). |

---

### üßæ 2. **User Certification**
| Feature | Appdome | Build38 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| User Certificate Management | Supports client certificate authentication; integrates with PKI systems. | Offers strong user authentication including digital certificates. |
| Notes | Can enforce certificate pinning and mutual TLS. | SEE environment allows secure handling of user credentials. |

---

### üõ°Ô∏è 3. **Third-Party Risk Management**
| Feature | Appdome | Build38 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Third-Party Risk Mitigation | Limited visibility into third-party code behavior. Focuses on securing the app itself. | Offers isolation of third-party SDKs within its Secure Execution Environment. |
| Notes | Protects against tampering and reverse engineering. | Prevents leakage from third-party components through sandboxing. |

---

### üèóÔ∏è 4. **Multi-Tier Architecture**
| Feature | Appdome | Build38 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Multi-Tier Architecture Support | Not applicable directly; focuses on the mobile layer in architecture. | Similar focus‚Äîsecures the mobile layer in multi-tier systems. |
| Notes | Works at the mobile app layer; does not manage backend or network tiers. | SEE operates within the app to isolate sensitive functions. |

---

### üì¶ 5. **SIEM / Syslog Integration**
| Feature | Appdome | Build38 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| SIEM/Syslog Support | No direct integration; depends on backend logging tools. | No direct SIEM/syslog integration; logs are internal unless exported manually. |
| Notes | Relies on external systems for log aggregation. | Logs remain within the secure container unless extracted. |

---

### üìù 6. **Application Log**
| Feature | Appdome | Build38 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Application Logging | Limited ‚Äì no built-in centralized logging features. | Enhanced ‚Äì logs are captured internally and can be encrypted. |
| Notes | Logging must be handled by the app or backend. | Logs stored securely and not accessible to other apps or users. |

---

### üõë 7. **Privileged Access Management (PAM)**
| Feature | Appdome | Build38 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| PAM Support | Not a core function; manages access at the app level. | No direct PAM support; secures access to the app and data inside it. |
| Notes | Can integrate with IAM systems via SSO. | SEE prevents unauthorized access to privileged functions within the app. |

---

### üñ•Ô∏è 8. **PAM at External Host**
| Feature | Appdome | Build38 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| PAM for External Hosts | No ‚Äì not designed for server-side PAM. | No ‚Äì focuses on mobile device security, not external host management. |
| Notes | Integrates with external IAM systems but doesn't manage them. | Same as above ‚Äì limited to mobile runtime security. |

---

### üåç 9. **Data with Fourth Party**
| Feature | Appdome | Build38 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Handling Data with Fourth Parties | Depends on how the app uses third-party services. | Reduces exposure by isolating third-party SDKs. |
| Notes | Cannot control fourth-party behavior beyond app protection. | SEE limits communication and data sharing outside the secure container. |

---

### üé≠ 10. **Data Masking**
| Feature | Appdome | Build38 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Data Masking | No native data masking feature. | No direct data masking feature. |
| Notes | Developers must implement masking logic before using Appdome. | Masking must be done before data enters the app environment. |

---

### üö¶ 11. **Data in Transit**
| Feature | Appdome | Build38 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Encryption of Data in Transit | Yes ‚Äì supports TLS enforcement, certificate pinning, and secure communication. | Yes ‚Äì enforces secure communication channels and TLS. |
| Notes | Strong support via "Secure Communication" fusion. | SEE ensures all network traffic is protected. |

---

### üîí 12. **Data at Rest Encryption**
| Feature | Appdome | Build38 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Encryption of Data at Rest | Yes ‚Äì encrypts local storage using platform-level encryption. | Yes ‚Äì encrypts app data at rest within the SEE. |
| Notes | Uses Android Keystore and iOS Keychain. | SEE provides its own encrypted storage mechanism. |

---

### üß± 13. **Data Isolation**
| Feature | Appdome | Build38 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Data Isolation | Moderate ‚Äì leverages OS-level sandboxing. | Strong ‚Äì SEE isolates app data from the rest of the device. |
| Notes | Protection against inter-app data leaks. | SEE prevents other apps from accessing its memory or files. |

---

### üìÅ 14. **No Data or Records Stored On**
| Feature | Appdome | Build38 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Zero Data Storage | Possible if configured ‚Äì app data can be ephemeral. | Possible ‚Äì SEE allows configuration to avoid persistent storage. |
| Notes | Depends on app design and policies enforced post-build. | SEE can be configured to not store any data persistently. |

### üß† Final Thoughts:
- **Appdome** is ideal for teams looking to quickly add enterprise-grade security features to mobile apps **without modifying source code**, especially in environments where integration with existing IAM systems is important.
- **Build38 (SEE)** excels in **runtime isolation**, **SDK sandboxing**, and **secure execution** of sensitive operations, making it a good fit for high-security applications like mobile banking or government apps.
