Excellent question!

> **"Who checks eBPF rules?"**

Let’s break it down clearly.

---

## 🔍 TL;DR:

> **eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) rules are enforced directly by the Linux kernel**, and they are **checked and executed at runtime** when triggered by events like network packets, system calls, or tracepoints.

They’re not "called" or "checked" by another component like Calico or NeuVector — instead, once loaded into the kernel, they run automatically in response to specific triggers.

## 🧱 What Is eBPF?

**eBPF** is a powerful Linux kernel technology that allows safe, sandboxed programs to run in the kernel without changing kernel source code or loading modules.

In Kubernetes networking and security:
- Tools like **Cilium**, **Calico (in eBPF mode)**, and **NeuVector** use eBPF to enforce **network policies**, **load balancing**, and **observability** with high performance.

---

## 🧠 How Are eBPF Rules Checked and Enforced?

There are **three main phases**:

---

### ✅ 1. **Verification Phase (by Kernel)**

Before any eBPF program is loaded into the kernel, it goes through a **verifier**.

#### The verifier does things like:
- Ensures the program will **always terminate** (no infinite loops)
- Prevents **invalid memory access**
- Validates **register usage**
- Checks for **security constraints**

If verification fails, the program is rejected.

> 🔒 This ensures that no malicious or unsafe code can be injected via eBPF.

---

### ✅ 2. **Loading Phase (by User Space Tool)**

A user-space tool (like Cilium agent, Calico node, or NeuVector enforcer) compiles and loads the eBPF program into the kernel.

This is usually done via:
- `libbpf` library
- `iproute2`, `bpftool`, or custom tooling

Once loaded, the eBPF program attaches to a hook point such as:
- Network interface (for packet filtering)
- cgroup (for applying policies to containers)
- Tracepoint (for monitoring syscalls)

---

### ✅ 3. **Execution Phase (by Kernel at Runtime)**

When an event happens (e.g., a packet arrives), the kernel runs the eBPF program **automatically**.

Examples:
- A packet arrives on `eth0` → eBPF filter decides whether to allow or drop it
- A container makes a syscall → eBPF logs or blocks it based on policy
- A tracepoint fires → eBPF collects metrics and sends them to Prometheus

> ⚡ All of this happens **without context switching to userspace**, making eBPF **very fast and efficient**.

## 🔐 Who Loads and Manages These eBPF Rules?

While the **kernel** executes and verifies the rules, tools like these **generate, load, and manage** them:

| Tool | Uses eBPF For | Description |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| **Cilium** | Networking, Security Policies, Observability | Full eBPF-based CNI |
| **Calico (in eBPF mode)** | Policy enforcement, Network dataplane | Alternative to iptables |
| **NeuVector** | Security policies, Threat detection | Enhances Kubernetes policies |
| **Pixie** | Observability, Tracing | Debugging Kubernetes apps using eBPF |
| **Katran** (by Meta) | Load Balancing | High-performance L4 LB using XDP/eBPF |

These tools:
- Generate eBPF bytecode
- Load it into the kernel
- Maintain maps/tables used for lookups (e.g., IP -> pod label)
- Watch Kubernetes API to dynamically update rules

## 📌 Summary Table

| Question | Answer |
|---------|--------|
| **Who checks eBPF rules?** | The **Linux kernel verifier** during load time |
| **Who runs eBPF rules?** | The **Linux kernel**, when triggered by events |
| **Who creates and manages eBPF rules?** | Tools like **Cilium**, **Calico**, **NeuVector**, etc. |
| **Are eBPF rules persistent?** | No — usually reloaded on reboot or pod creation |
| **Can I inspect eBPF rules?** | Yes — using `bpftool`, `cilium`, or other CLI tools |

## 🧪 Want to See eBPF in Action?

You can inspect eBPF programs using:

```bash
# List all loaded eBPF programs
sudo bpftool prog show

# List eBPF maps
sudo bpftool map show
```

Or if you're using Cilium:

```bash
cilium bpf lb list
```

Or check logs from the enforcer pods in NeuVector or Calico.
