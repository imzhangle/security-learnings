### 🔍 Great question!

**Does Appdome achieve the same level of secure communication as Build38 SEAL?**

---

## ❌ **Short Answer: No — Appdome does not achieve the same depth or breadth of secure communication as Build38.**

Appdome offers **standard TLS protections with certificate pinning**, but it lacks the **proprietary, runtime-enhanced security layers** that make **Build38 SEAL** so effective in high-security environments like **Open Banking**.

Let’s break down why.

---

## 🧠 1. What Appdome Does Well

Appdome provides **no-code mobile app security features**, including:

| Feature | Appdome Support |
|--------|----------------|
| **Certificate Pinning** | ✅ Yes (standard) |
| **HTTPS Enforcement** | ✅ Yes |
| **OWASP SSL Pinning** | ✅ Yes |
| **WAF Integration** | ✅ Yes |
| **TLS 1.2/1.3 Support** | ✅ Yes |

✅ These are **good baseline protections** for general-purpose apps and mid-tier enterprise use cases.

## ⚠️ 2. Where Appdome Falls Short vs. Build38 SEAL

Here’s where **Appdome doesn’t match Build38** in terms of **secure communication depth**:

| Feature | Appdome | Build38 SEAL | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------|--------------|----------------|
| **Proprietary Secure Layer** | ❌ | ✅ (SEAL protocol) | Adds protection beyond standard TLS |
| **Runtime MITM Detection** | ❌ | ✅ | Detects live interception attempts |
| **Device Integrity Binding** | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ | Communication only allowed from trusted app/device |
| **Session-Specific Encryption** | ❌ | ✅ | Prevents replay attacks |
| **Fraud Engine Integration** | ❌ | ✅ | Shares device risk score with backend |
| **Anti-Bypass Protection** | ⚠️ Basic | ✅ | Resists Frida/Burp bypasses |
| **Dynamic Certificate Management** | ❌ | ✅ | Allows OTA updates to pinned certs |
| **Used in Open Banking Environments** | ❌ | ✅ | Required by PSD2 RTS |

---

## 🔐 3. Real-World Example: Bypassing Protections

| Scenario | Appdome (Standard Pinning) | Build38 SEAL |
|---------|----------------------------|--------------|
| Attacker uses Burp Suite + Frida to bypass cert pinning | ✅ Often possible | ❌ Very hard |
| Device is rooted/jailbroken | ❌ May allow connection | ✅ SEAL blocks communication |
| Fake certificate installed | ❌ May bypass pinning | ✅ SEAL detects and rejects |
| Fraudster replays transaction | ❌ Possible | ✅ SEAL prevents |
| Backend receives request from tampered app | ❌ Possible | ✅ SEAL blocks |

> 🔑 Key Insight: Appdome protects against **passive network threats**, while **Build38 SEAL actively detects and blocks active attacks** during runtime.

---

## 📦 4. Integration & DevOps Friendliness

| Feature | Appdome | Build38 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **No-code integration** | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ SDK-based |
| **CI/CD compatibility** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Requires code changes** | ❌ | ❌ (but SDK must be added) |
| **Supports hybrid apps (React Native, Flutter)** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

So both tools integrate well into modern pipelines — but **Appdome wins on ease of use**, while **Build38 wins on security depth**.

---

## 🎯 5. When to Choose Each

### ✅ Use Appdome if:
- You want **quick, no-code implementation**
- Your app has **moderate security needs**
- You don’t need **deep fraud integration** or **regulatory compliance** (like PSD2)
- You're building **internal tools or non-financial apps**

### ✅ Use Build38 SEAL if:
- You're in **financial services**, **Open Banking**, or **regulated fintech**
- You need **deep MITM detection and runtime protection**
- You want to integrate with **fraud engines like BioCatch**
- You’re defending against **advanced attackers using Frida, Burp, etc.**

## 📊 Summary Table

| Criteria | Appdome | Build38 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Certificate Pinning** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Proprietary Secure Layer** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Runtime MITM Detection** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Device Integrity Check** | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| **Fraud Engine Integration** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Used in Regulated Environments** | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| **Ease of Use / No-code** | ✅ | ⚠️ |
| **DevOps Friendly** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Compliance (PSD2, ISO 27001)** | ⚠️ | ✅ |
