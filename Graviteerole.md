If you're managing **multiple organizations (orgs)** in **Gravitee.io**, and each organization needs to consume different APIs, it's important to structure your Gravitee environment efficiently. Here‚Äôs a comprehensive guide to help you manage **organization-specific API access** using Gravitee‚Äôs capabilities.

---

## üß© Goal:
Ensure that each organization only consumes the APIs they are authorized for, while maintaining centralized control and scalability.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommended Strategy

### 1. **Use Organizations & Environments**
Gravitee supports multi-tenancy via **Environments** (not Organizations per se), but you can simulate org-based separation using environments or groups.

#### Option A: Use Separate Environments Per Organization
- Create one **Environment** per organization.
- Each environment has its own set of APIs, applications, and settings.
- Ideal if organizations have completely separate governance models.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Gravitee Enterprise Edition for full environment management.

#### Option B: Single Environment with Tags / Groups
- Keep all APIs and users in one environment.
- Use **Tags**, **Groups**, and **Roles** to enforce access control.
- More manageable for smaller teams or shared infrastructure.

---

### 2. **API Visibility Control by Organization**

You can limit which APIs an organization sees or uses through:

#### üîí Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Define **custom roles** for each organization (e.g., `OrgA-User`, `OrgB-Developer`).
- Assign these roles to **Applications** or **Users** belonging to the respective orgs.
- Apply **permissions** on specific APIs based on roles.

#### üè∑Ô∏è API Tagging
- Tag APIs by organization (e.g., `org-a`, `org-b`).
- Use tag filtering in the portal so that users only see APIs tagged for their org.

---

### 3. **Application Isolation per Org**

Each organization should register its own **Application** in Gravitee.

- Applications represent consumers of APIs.
- You can restrict which APIs a given application can subscribe to.
- Use **Application Groups** or **Metadata** to associate apps with organizations.

---

### 4. **API Plans & Subscriptions**

For fine-grained control:

- Create **Plans** per organization (or per API per org).
- Only allow subscriptions from the relevant org's Application(s).
- Optionally apply **Quotas**, **Rate Limits**, or **API Keys** specific to each org.

---

### 5. **Custom Portal Experience per Org (Optional)**

To provide a personalized developer experience:

- Deploy multiple **Gravitee Portals**, each customized for an organization.
- Or use **single sign-on (SSO)** + role-based visibility within a shared portal.

> Tip: You can deploy multiple portals behind different subdomains or paths (e.g., `portal.orga.example.com`, `portal.orgb.example.com`) and configure them to show only relevant APIs.

---

### 6. **Authentication & Identity Management**

- Integrate with your identity provider (like Keycloak, Auth0, Azure AD, etc.) to authenticate users.
- Map users to **Groups** or **Roles** based on their organization.
- Ensure that Gravitee inherits the user's org context for access control.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Steps Summary

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Set up **one environment** (unless strict isolation needed) |
| 2 | Create **Groups/Roles** per organization |
| 3 | Tag APIs per organization |
| 4 | Configure **Plans** and **Access Policies** based on org |
| 5 | Register **Applications** per organization |
| 6 | Restrict visibility/subscription using tags, roles, and permissions |
| 7 | Customize portals (optional) |
| 8 | Integrate with IDP for org-aware authentication |

---

## üîê Security Considerations

- Regularly audit who has access to what APIs.
- Use strong **rate limiting/quota enforcement** to prevent abuse.
- Monitor usage per org using analytics and logs.
- Rotate credentials like API keys periodically.

---

## üìà Monitoring & Analytics

- Use Gravitee Analytics to monitor traffic per organization.
- Filter metrics by **application**, **plan**, or **tag**.
- Generate reports per org for billing or capacity planning.

---

## üîÑ Automation Tips

- Automate creation of **applications**, **plans**, and **subscriptions** via **Management API** or CI/CD pipelines.
- Use **Gravitee CLI** or **Terraform Provider** to manage configurations as code.

---

## üß™ Example Use Case

**Scenario:**  
- Org A: Needs access to `Payments API` and `Inventory API`.  
- Org B: Needs access to `Shipping API` and `Inventory API`.

**Setup:**
- Tag APIs accordingly (`payments`, `shipping`, `inventory`)
- Create roles: `OrgA-Dev`, `OrgB-Dev`
- Allow roles to subscribe only to appropriate plans
- Applications under Org A/B get access to only the APIs they‚Äôre allowed
