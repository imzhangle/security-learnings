### ✅ Excellent point — and you're absolutely right to question it!

Let’s **review the security capabilities** of:

- **Appdome**
- **Build38 SEAL**
- **Digital.ai Application Protection**

And clarify the **true nature of their protections**, especially regarding:

- **Code obfuscation**
- **Anti-tampering**
- **Anti-debugging**

---

## 🔍 Clarifying Key Terms

Before diving in, let’s define what we mean by these terms in the context of **mobile app hardening**.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Code Obfuscation** | Renaming classes/methods, scrambling control flow, encrypting strings to make reverse engineering difficult |
| **Anti-Tampering** | Detecting if the app binary has been modified or repackaged |
| **Anti-Debugging** | Preventing debuggers like GDB or LLDB from attaching to the app process |
| **Wrapper-Based Protection** | Protecting the compiled app without modifying source code (e.g., post-processing APK/IPA) |

Now, let’s go through each vendor carefully.

---

## 🧱 1. **Digital.ai Application Protection**

### ✅ YES – Full Code Obfuscation + Runtime Protections

Digital.ai is one of the **leading platforms for mobile app hardening**, with deep integration into the build process.

### 🔐 Security Capabilities:
| Feature | Supported? | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Code Obfuscation** | ✅ Yes | Control flow obfuscation, string encryption, symbol stripping |
| **Anti-Tampering** | ✅ Yes | Binary checksum validation |
| **Anti-Debugging** | ✅ Yes | Debugger detection and prevention |
| **Hook Detection** | ✅ Yes | Frida/Xposed detection |
| **Runtime Integrity Checks** | ✅ Yes | Memory inspection checks |
| **Used in Regulated Environments** | ✅ Yes | Open Banking, PCI DSS, ISO 27001 |
| **Integration Method** | SDK/toolchain | Requires build script modification |

✅ **Bottom Line**: Digital.ai offers **full-featured code obfuscation and runtime protection**, making it ideal for enterprise and financial apps where IP protection is critical.

## 🔒 2. **Build38 SEAL**

### ⚠️ NO – No Traditional Code Obfuscation  
### ✅ YES – Strong Anti-Tampering & Anti-Debugging via Runtime Protection

Build38 SEAL focuses on **secure communication and runtime integrity**, not traditional **code obfuscation**.

However, it does offer strong **anti-tampering**, **anti-debugging**, and **hook detection**, which can be more effective than obfuscation in some real-world scenarios.

### 🔐 Security Capabilities:
| Feature | Supported? | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Code Obfuscation** | ❌ No | Does not rename classes or scramble logic |
| **Anti-Tampering** | ✅ Yes | Detects binary modifications at runtime |
| **Anti-Debugging** | ✅ Yes | Detects debugger attachment |
| **Hook Detection** | ✅ Yes | Frida/Xposed detection |
| **Runtime Integrity Checks** | ✅ Yes | Device attestation, MITM detection |
| **Secure Communication Layer** | ✅ Yes | SEAL protocol adds session-specific encryption |
| **Used in Regulated Environments** | ✅ Yes | Widely used in EU fintech/Open Banking |
| **Integration Method** | SDK-based | Minimal code changes required |

✅ **Bottom Line**: Build38 SEAL doesn’t obfuscate code but provides **deep runtime protection**, making it extremely hard for attackers to manipulate the app during execution.

## 🛡️ 3. **Appdome**

### ❌ NO – No Traditional Code Obfuscation  
### ✅ YES – Wrapper-Based Anti-Tampering & Anti-Debugging

Appdome uses a **wrapper-based approach** — meaning it applies protections to a compiled APK or IPA **without requiring access to source code**.

While it doesn't perform **traditional code obfuscation**, it does provide **strong anti-tampering**, **anti-debugging**, and **MITM detection**.

### 🔐 Security Capabilities:
| Feature | Supported? | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Code Obfuscation** | ❌ No | Doesn’t modify source or compiled logic |
| **Anti-Tampering** | ✅ Yes | Detects binary modifications |
| **Anti-Debugging** | ✅ Yes | Prevents debugger attachment |
| **Hook Detection** | ⚠️ Limited | Basic hook detection possible |
| **Runtime Integrity Checks** | ✅ Yes | Environment checks at launch |
| **Secure Communication Layer** | ⚠️ Standard TLS only | No SEAL-like custom protocol |
| **Used in Regulated Environments** | ⚠️ Limited | More common in internal/consumer apps |
| **Integration Method** | Wrapper-based | No-code / no-source-code needed |

✅ **Bottom Line**: Appdome does **not obfuscate code**, but its **wrapper-based protections** are **very effective at preventing runtime tampering and debugging**, especially for teams that want **no-code deployment**.
