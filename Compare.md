### 🔐 **Comparison of Appdome, Build38 SEAL, Digital.ai for PSD2 SCA (Strong Customer Authentication)**

When securing mobile banking apps under **PSD2 (Revised Payment Services Directive)**, **Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)** is a **core requirement** — especially under **RTS Article 12**.

Let’s compare how the following tools support or complement **SCA requirements**:

| Tool | Supports SCA? | How? |
|------|----------------|------|
| **Build38 SEAL** | ✅ Yes – Strongly supports SCA workflows | Secure comm, device integrity binding, fraud engine integration |
| **Digital.ai Application Protection** | ✅ Yes – Indirect support via app integrity | Anti-tampering, anti-debugging, code obfuscation |
| **Appdome** | ✅ Yes – Basic support | Certificate pinning, MITM detection, no-code protection |

---

## 🧱 1. **What Is SCA Under PSD2 RTS Article 12?**

**Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)** requires:
- At least **two of the following factors**:
  - Something you know (e.g., password)
  - Something you have (e.g., OTP token, mobile device)
  - Something you are (e.g., biometrics)

It also mandates that:
- Communication must be secure
- The authentication process must not be tampered with
- Device integrity and session validity must be verified

This means **mobile app security tools must enable or protect these flows**, not just enforce them.
