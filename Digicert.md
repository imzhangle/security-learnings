  - DigiCert integrates with identity providers (IdPs) such as Azure AD, Okta, Ping Identity, etc., allowing Single Sign-On (SSO) via SAML or OAuth protocols.
  - For internal employee access to DigiCert services (e.g., CertCentral), SSO can be configured using enterprise IAM systems already in place at Santander.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Ensure that SSO implementation supports **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** and aligns with Santander‚Äôs existing IAM architecture.
  - Audit user provisioning/deprovisioning mechanisms to maintain least privilege and separation of duties.

---

### **2. User Certification**
- **Evaluation:**
  - DigiCert provides Qualified Web Authentication Certificates and can issue **Qualified Certificates for Electronic Seals and Signatures** compliant with **eIDAS Article 3(19)**.
  - User certification includes identity verification through accredited Trust Service Providers (TSPs), which may involve face-to-face or remote LoA4 verification.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Confirm that DigiCert has **QSCD (Qualified Signature Creation Device)** status under eIDAS and that their certificate policies meet Swiss FINMA circulars (e.g., FINMA Circular 2022/1 on IT Risk Management).
  - Use **ETSI EN 319 401/411** standards for qualified electronic signatures and seals.

---

### **3. Third Party Risk Assessment**
- **Evaluation:**
  - DigiCert undergoes regular third-party audits (SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, eIDAS conformity assessments).
  - They provide transparency into their risk management framework and have documented business continuity plans.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Conduct a formal **third-party risk assessment** aligned with Santander‚Äôs vendor management policy.
  - Include clauses related to **data sovereignty**, **sub-processing restrictions**, and **incident reporting obligations** in contracts.
  - Evaluate DigiCert‚Äôs Swiss presence and whether data processing occurs within Switzerland or the EU.

---

### **4. Multi-Tier Architecture**
- **Evaluation:**
  - DigiCert operates a **multi-tier PKI architecture**, including Root, Intermediate, and Issuing CAs.
  - Their infrastructure is designed to isolate key material and enforce strict access controls.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Validate that DigiCert‚Äôs architecture supports **cross-certification** if needed with internal CA hierarchies.
  - Ensure that **HSMs (Hardware Security Modules)** are FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified and used across all tiers.
  - Confirm geographic distribution and redundancy of infrastructure for high availability and disaster recovery.

---

### **5. SIEM / Syslog Integration**
- **Evaluation:**
  - DigiCert CertCentral offers **APIs and webhooks** for logging and event notifications.
  - These logs can be forwarded to a SIEM (e.g., Splunk, QRadar, ELK) via syslog-compatible integrations.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Implement real-time log ingestion from DigiCert APIs into the SIEM.
  - Define correlation rules for suspicious activities (e.g., bulk certificate issuance, unauthorized API access).
  - Ensure secure transmission (TLS) and integrity (signing) of logs.

---

### **6. Application Logs**
- **Evaluation:**
  - DigiCert maintains detailed audit logs for all certificate lifecycle events (issuance, revocation, renewal).
  - These logs are tamper-evident and available via the CertCentral portal or API.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Integrate application logs into the bank‚Äôs centralized logging platform.
  - Retain logs for compliance with Swiss banking secrecy laws and FINMA requirements (typically 5‚Äì10 years).
  - Perform periodic log reviews and set up alerts for critical operations.

---

### **7. Privileged Access Management (PAM)**
- **Evaluation:**
  - DigiCert restricts privileged access to certificate authorities and administrative functions.
  - Administrative roles follow the principle of least privilege and require multi-factor authentication.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Require DigiCert to use **PAM solutions** (e.g., CyberArk, Thycotic) or equivalent protections for admin access.
  - Review DigiCert‚Äôs **separation of duties** policies and access control models.
  - Ensure that Santander‚Äôs own PAM tools can integrate with DigiCert for any internal administrative workflows.

---

### **8. PAM at External Host**
- **Evaluation:**
  - If DigiCert hosts infrastructure externally (e.g., cloud-based HSMs), it must comply with **eIDAS QSCD requirements** and Swiss data protection laws.
  - DigiCert uses AWS CloudHSM and Microsoft Azure Key Vault in some deployments but ensures physical and logical separation of customer keys.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Verify that external hosting environments support **customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK)** and are located in jurisdictions acceptable to Santander (preferably EU/Switzerland).
  - Assess the use of **on-premises or hybrid HSMs** if required for regulatory reasons.
  - Confirm that DigiCert does not have direct access to private keys stored in HSMs.

---

## üá®üá≠ **Swiss-Specific Considerations**
- **Data Localization:** Ensure that personal data and cryptographic materials are processed within Switzerland or an adequate jurisdiction (EU/CH adequacy decision exists).
- **Regulatory Alignment:**
  - Align with **FINMA Circular 2022/1 on IT Risk Management**.
  - Ensure compliance with **FEDPI (Federal Data Protection Act)** and **GDPR-equivalent Swiss laws**.
- **Digital Signature Compliance:**
  - Confirm that DigiCert certificates meet **Swiss ZertES law**, which governs qualified trust services in Switzerland.
  - DigiCert Switzerland AG is present and should be able to offer locally compliant services.

To support **Santander Private Bank Switzerland** employees authenticating into a **DigiCert Signing Room** on behalf of customers, the integration must ensure secure and compliant access using **Single Sign-On (SSO)** while maintaining strict controls for digital signature workflows.

Below is a detailed breakdown tailored to your scenario:

---

## üîê **Use Case: Santander Employee SSO to DigiCert Signing Room (On Behalf of Customer)**

### üéØ **Objective**
Allow authenticated **Santander employees** to securely enter a **DigiCert Signing Room**, where they can assist **customers** in signing documents (e.g., banking agreements, investment forms), ensuring:
- Strong identity verification of the employee
- Non-repudiation of signatures
- Compliance with Swiss and EU regulations (ZertES, eIDAS, FINMA)
- Auditability and logging of all actions

---

## ‚úÖ **Key Components**

### 1. **SSO Integration**
- **Authentication Flow:**  
  Employees authenticate via Santander‚Äôs internal Identity Provider (IdP) using SAML or OAuth2/OpenID Connect (OIDC).
- **Supported IdPs:**  
  Azure AD, Okta, Ping Identity, ADFS, etc.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  
  Must be enforced as part of the SSO flow to meet LoA3/LoA4 requirements under ZertES/eIDAS.

### 2. **Signing Room Access Control**
- **User Mapping:**  
  DigiCert maps the authenticated employee identity (via SSO) to their account in the Signing Room.
- **Role Assignment:**  
  Define roles such as ‚ÄúSigner,‚Äù ‚ÄúCC,‚Äù or ‚ÄúIn Person signer‚Äù depending on the employee's role in the document workflow.
- **Customer Representation:**  
  The employee may act as a representative of the customer. This should be documented and approved by the customer beforehand, ideally through a power of attorney or similar legal instrument.

### 3. **Identity Proofing & Verification**
- **Employee Onboarding:**  
  Ensure that each employee has undergone appropriate identity proofing before being granted access to the Signing Room system.
- **Customer Verification:**  
  Customers must also go through identity verification steps (e.g., video ID check, government ID upload, SMS/email OTP) when required by the Signing Room configuration.
