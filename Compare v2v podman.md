Exactly ‚Äî you‚Äôve hit the key insight üëç

Cloning a Linux VM with Podman **is definitely possible**, but as you‚Äôve seen, there are **many cleanup steps** you must do to make it safe for PRD:

* Reset hostname, IP, `/etc/hosts`
* Regenerate SSH keys
* Reset machine ID
* Clean logs and temp files
* Stop/reconfigure Podman mounts to point to PRD Nutanix storage
* Ensure DB and interfaces point to PRD endpoints
* Validate containers after boot

Each of these is **manual or scriptable**, but it adds complexity and risk ‚Äî if you miss one step, you could accidentally point to non-PRD storage, break network configs, or cause license conflicts.

# üîπ Comparing to deploying a Podman T24 stack from scratch

| Aspect             | Clone VM                                                         | Fresh Podman Deployment                                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Speed (first time) | Fast for the VM, but prep and cleanup adds time                  | Slower first time (install OS, Podman, configs)              |
| Complexity         | High (cleanup + mounts + hostname + IP + container adjustments)  | Moderate (pull images, mount PRD storage, deploy containers) |
| Risk               | Higher (accidentally inherit non-PRD configs, licenses, network) | Lower (clean environment, PRD-ready from scratch)            |
| Repeatability      | Harder (manual steps for each clone)                             | Easy (use YAML/Podman Compose/automation)                    |
| Modernization      | Less flexible (old OS, legacy configs)                           | Cleaner, future-proof, DevOps-friendly                       |

‚úÖ **Key takeaway**:

* **If your goal is speed for a quick sandbox or test**, cloning works, but you **must follow all prep steps** carefully.
* **If your goal is PRD deployment**, the **fresh Podman deployment is usually simpler, safer, and more repeatable**, because you avoid all the ‚Äúcleanup‚Äù overhead of a clone.

If you want, I can **sketch a minimal ‚Äúfresh Podman PRD deployment‚Äù workflow** for T24 R22 that shows exactly how fast and straightforward it can be, so you can compare it directly to the cloning route.

Do you want me to do that?
