### 🔐 Great Question!

You're asking:

> **Which version of Elasticsearch supports TLS 1.2+, strong cipher suites by default, and allows enforcing them**, so you can meet your security requirements without relying on external proxies.

Let’s walk through **Elasticsearch's TLS support timeline**, what versions enable secure defaults, and how to enforce **TLS versions** and **cipher suites** manually when needed.

---

## ✅ TL;DR: Elasticsearch TLS Support Overview

| Elasticsearch Version | Native TLS Support | Notes |
|------------------------|--------------------|-------|
| ≤ 6.x                  | ❌ No native TLS support | Requires reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy) |
| 7.0 – 7.1              | ⚠️ Experimental TLS | Basic TLS features in commercial plugin |
| 7.1+                   | ✅ Yes              | TLS/SSL support in core (with Elastic Stack license) |
| 7.7+                   | ✅ Yes              | TLS support in free (Basic) license too |
| 8.x+                   | ✅ Yes              | TLS enabled by default for HTTP and transport |

So:
- If you're using **Elasticsearch 7.7+ (free)** or **7.1+ (with a subscription)**, you have **native TLS support**.
- For full enforcement of **TLS versions** and **cipher suites**, you must configure it explicitly — even in newer versions.

---

## 🧱 What Elasticsearch Enables By Default

Starting from **Elasticsearch 7.7+ (Basic license)**:

- TLS is **supported**, but not always enabled by default
- Cipher suites are selected based on JVM defaults
- You must opt-in to TLS via configuration files
- Transport layer (node-to-node communication) and HTTP layer are configured separately

---

## 🔒 To Be Fully Compliant with Your Requirements, You Must:

| Requirement | Action Required |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Enable TLS for HTTP and Transport | ✅ Yes |
| Disable TLS 1.0/1.1 | ✅ Yes |
| Restrict cipher suites | ✅ Yes |
| Enforce mutual TLS (mTLS) | ✅ Optional |
| Use FIPS mode (if required) | ✅ Optional (Enterprise only) |

---

## ✅ Example: Elasticsearch 7.11+ / 8.x Secure TLS Configuration

Here’s an example `elasticsearch.yml` config that enforces:

- TLS 1.2+
- Strong cipher suites
- mTLS (optional)

```yaml
# Enable TLS for HTTP interface
xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: true
xpack.security.http.ssl.verification_mode: certificate
xpack.security.http.ssl.key: certs/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.key
xpack.security.http.ssl.certificate: certs/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.crt
xpack.security.http.ssl.cipher_suites: TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
xpack.security.http.ssl.supported_protocols: TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3

# Enable TLS for Transport (node-to-node)
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
xpack.security.transport.ssl.verification_mode: certificate
xpack.security.transport.ssl.key: certs/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.key
xpack.security.transport.ssl.certificate: certs/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.crt
xpack.security.transport.ssl.cipher_suites: TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
xpack.security.transport.ssl.supported_protocols: TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3

# Optional: Require client certificates (mTLS)
xpack.security.http.ssl.client_authentication: required
```

> 💡 Certificates should be placed in the `certs/elasticsearch/` directory (or wherever you mount them).

## 📁 File Structure

```
/elasticsearch
  └── config/
      └── elasticsearch.yml
  └── certs/
      └── elasticsearch/
          ├── elasticsearch.key
          ├── elasticsearch.crt
          └── ca.crt
```

---

## 🧪 How to Test TLS Settings in Elasticsearch

Use `curl` with verbose output:

```bash
curl -k --cert certs/client.crt --key certs/client.key \
  --tlsv1.2 --ciphers TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 \
  https://elasticsearch-host:9200
```

If Elasticsearch doesn't support the cipher suite or TLS version → connection fails.

Or use `openssl`:

```bash
openssl s_client -connect elasticsearch-host:9200 -tls1_2 \
  -cipher TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
```

## 📊 Summary Table

| Elasticsearch Version | Native TLS Support? | Strong TLS Defaults? | Needs Manual Config? |
|------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| ≤ 6.x                  | ❌ No                | ❌ N/A                 | ❌ Not possible without proxy |
| 7.0 – 7.6              | ✅ Yes (commercial)  | ❌ No                  | ✅ Yes                 |
| 7.7+ (Basic License)   | ✅ Yes               | ❌ No (must configure) | ✅ Yes                 |
| 8.0+                   | ✅ Yes               | ✅ Better defaults     | ✅ Recommended         |

---

## ✅ Best Practice Recommendation

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Use Elasticsearch ≥ 7.7 | For free TLS support |
| Always enable TLS for HTTP and Transport | Especially in production |
| Set `supported_protocols` to disable TLS 1.0/1.1 | Prevent downgrade attacks |
| Set `cipher_suites` to allow only modern ones | ECDHE, CHACHA20, AES-GCM |
| Enable mTLS (optional) | For internal services |
| Monitor logs for handshake failures | Detect misconfigurations early |
