To **allow network communication between only two specific services** in the **same ECS cluster**, while **blocking all other traffic**, you can use a combination of:

- **AWS Security Groups**
- **ECS Task Networking (VPC mode)**
- Optionally, **Cloud Map for DNS-based service discovery**

---

## ‚úÖ Goal Recap:
You want to:
- Allow traffic from Service A to Service B
- Block all other traffic to Service B (including from other services or hosts)
- Ensure it's secure and works within an ECS cluster (EC2 or Fargate)

---

# üîê Solution: Use Security Groups + VPC Mode

This is the most common and effective method.

---

## üß± Architecture Overview

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| ECS Cluster | Hosts both services |
| Tasks | Run in `awsvpc` mode (Fargate default, EC2 optional) |
| Security Group A | Assigned to Service A tasks |
| Security Group B | Assigned to Service B tasks |
| VPC | All tasks are in same VPC |

---

## üîÅ Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. **Run ECS Tasks in `awsvpc` Network Mode**

Ensure your task definitions use `"networkMode": "awsvpc"` (required for Fargate, optional for EC2):

```json
{
  "family": "my-task",
  "networkMode": "awsvpc",
  ...
}
```

> This gives each task its own elastic network interface (ENI) with a private IP in the VPC.

---

### 2. **Create Two Security Groups**

#### SG-A (`sg-service-a`)
- Assigned to Service A tasks
- Allows outbound traffic as needed

#### SG-B (`sg-service-b`)
- Assigned to Service B tasks
- Inbound rules:
    - Allow TCP (or UDP) on required port(s) **only from `sg-service-a`**
    - Deny everything else by default

Example inbound rule for SG-B:
```bash
Type: Custom TCP
Protocol: TCP
Port Range: 80
Source: sg-service-a (security group ID)
Description: Allow HTTP from Service A
```

---

### 3. **Assign Security Groups to ECS Services**

When creating or updating your ECS services:

- For **Service A**: Assign `sg-service-a`
- For **Service B**: Assign `sg-service-b`

In AWS Console or CLI when creating the service:

```bash
--network-configuration "awsvpcConfiguration={subnets=[subnet-xxxx],securityGroups=[sg-xxxx]}"
```

---

### 4. **(Optional) Use Cloud Map for Private DNS Resolution**

To make communication easier and more readable:

- Set up **Cloud Map** with a namespace like `internal.example.com`
- Register Service B with name `service-b.internal.example.com`
- Service A can call `http://service-b.internal.example.com`

This helps avoid hardcoded IPs but doesn't affect security ‚Äî still controlled by SG rules.

---

## ‚úÖ Result

- Service A ‚Üí ‚úÖ Can reach Service B
- Any other service or host ‚Üí ‚ùå Cannot reach Service B
- Communication happens over **private IPs inside the VPC**
- Fully secured at the **network layer** using AWS Security Groups

---

## üìå Example Scenario

Let‚Äôs say:
- Service A = `orders`
- Service B = `payments`
- Port = `80`

### SG Rules for `payments` service (SG-B):
| Rule | Direction | Protocol | Port | Source |
|------|-----------|----------|------|--------|
| Allow HTTP from orders | Inbound | TCP | 80 | `sg-for-orders` |
| Default deny all other inbound | Inbound | All | All | 0.0.0.0/0 |

Now only `orders` service can talk to `payments`.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Bonus: Add TLS for Data-in-Transit Encryption

Even if traffic is internal:
- Use HTTPS/TLS between services
- Terminate TLS using ALB or directly in containers
- Use ACM for certificate management

---

## üì¶ Summary Table

| Feature | Enabled? |
|--------|----------|
| Only allow Service A to Service B | ‚úÖ Using SG rules |
| Block all other traffic | ‚úÖ Default deny |
| Works across Fargate & EC2 | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Requires VPC | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Supports DNS names | ‚úÖ With Cloud Map |
| Encrypted comm | ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional via TLS |

Would you like a full **Terraform template** or **CloudFormation YAML** that sets this up automatically?

Or a **CLI example** using `aws ecs create-service` with correct SGs and networking?
