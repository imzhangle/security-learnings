Great goal — you want a **DevOps-friendly** way to let **OpenShift generate and rotate JWT signing certificates automatically**, similar to how TLS is managed.

Unfortunately, **OpenShift doesn’t manage JWT signing keys out of the box**, but you **can automate this cleanly** using OpenShift-native tools. Here's how:

---

## ✅ Goal: Automate JWT signing certificate generation & rotation in OpenShift

You’ll need to:

1. Leverage **OpenShift Service CA** to generate certs
2. Extract or mount certs for Gravitee AM to use as signing keys
3. Automate updates and restarts of Gravitee AM when certs rotate

## 🔧 Recommended Architecture

| Component                    | Purpose                                               |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Service CA**               | Auto-generates a TLS cert/key pair for a service      |
| **Secret**                   | Holds the cert/key (OpenShift updates it on rotation) |
| **Init Container / Sidecar** | Converts TLS key to JWT key format (PEM or JWK)       |
| **Gravitee AM Pod**          | Mounts the key as JWT signing key                     |
| **Deployment**               | Triggers rollout when the secret is updated           |

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. **Annotate a Secret to Get OpenShift to Generate a Cert**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: jwt-signing-cert
  annotations:
    service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name: jwt-signing-cert
type: kubernetes.io/tls
```

OpenShift will:

* Automatically generate a cert/key for the service
* Store it in the `jwt-signing-cert` secret
* Rotate it before expiry (and keep it valid)

---

### 2. **Mount the Secret into Gravitee AM**

In your `Deployment`:

```yaml
volumeMounts:
  - name: jwt-key-volume
    mountPath: /etc/gravitee/jwt
    readOnly: true

volumes:
  - name: jwt-key-volume
    secret:
      secretName: jwt-signing-cert
```

---

### 3. **Configure Gravitee AM to Use the Key**

In `gravitee.yml` or env vars:

```yaml
keystore:
  type: pem
  path: /etc/gravitee/jwt/tls.key
  cert: /etc/gravitee/jwt/tls.crt
  password: ""  # PEMs usually don't need one
```

---

### 4. **Ensure Gravitee AM Reloads on Rotation**

OpenShift **updates the secret** in place but does **not restart pods**.

🔁 Add an **annotation to Deployment** to trigger rollout when the cert updates:

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        secret.revision/hash: "{{ sha256sum of secret }}"
```

You can automate this hash update using:

* A CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitOps)
* A Kubernetes operator
* A small controller script (e.g., in Python or Bash)

---

### 5. **\[Optional] Convert Cert to JWK Format**

If Gravitee AM or clients require a JWK:

* Add a **sidecar** or **init container** to:

  * Read `/etc/gravitee/jwt/tls.key`
  * Convert to JWK format (e.g., using `pem-jwk` or `openssl` + script)
  * Output to a shared volume

| Convert to JWK (if needed) | Sidecar/init                         | ✅          |

### 🔄 Fully Automated DevOps Workflow:

You can set this all up once and then manage certs as **code + automation** — no manual renewal or copying of certs.

Would you like a **complete YAML example** with the Deployment, secret, and Gravitee config for this setup?



Technically, **yes**, you *can* use Gravitee Access Management’s **system default certificate** in production for JWT signing — **because JWT verification does not require a CA-signed certificate**. But in practice, **this is not recommended for production use**.

Here’s a clear breakdown:

---

## ✅ Why It *Could* Work

1. **JWTs use digital signatures**, not TLS trust chains.
2. Clients verify JWTs using Gravitee’s **public key (via JWKS)**.
3. That public key doesn’t need to be CA-signed — it just needs to be:

   * **Securely served** (e.g., over HTTPS)
   * **Trusted by the client** (fetched from a known source)

So from a **pure JWT mechanics** perspective, **yes** — the default key works.

---

## ❌ Why You Should **NOT Use It in Production**

| Concern                        | Problem with Default System Certificate                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔒 **Security**                | It's auto-generated, often with a **short expiry** (e.g., 1 year), and not rotated automatically. |
| 🔁 **Rotation**                | **No lifecycle management**: no automated rotation, expiration tracking, or key rollover support. |
| 🔑 **Key control**             | You don’t control the key generation — bad for audit/compliance.                                  |
| 🔄 **Reproducibility**         | You can't easily manage or restore the key in disaster recovery or backups.                       |
| 🔐 **Zero Trust / Federation** | Most production environments require **explicit key trust** and versioning.                       |

## 🔐 Production Best Practices for JWT in Gravitee AM

| Task               | Best Practice                                                               |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔑 JWT signing key | **Use a custom key pair** (self-signed is fine) that you manage             |
| 🔄 Key rotation    | Set up key versioning & JWKS updates (Gravitee supports multiple keys)      |
| 📜 TLS for JWKS    | Serve your JWKS endpoint over **HTTPS with a CA-signed cert**               |
| 🔁 Secret mgmt     | Store the key in an **OpenShift Secret** (or vault), and automate reloading |

---

## 🧠 TL;DR

> ✅ **Technically allowed**: Yes, you can use the system default cert for JWT in production.
> ❌ **Not recommended**: It’s insecure, unmanaged, and unsuitable for key lifecycle in a production-grade identity system.
