To securely allow your **Dev environment** to access files from **Prod** in your **on-prem Kiteworks Managed File Transfer (MFT)** setup, you need a **segregated, auditable, and policy-controlled** design. Here's a secure and scalable design approach:

---

## 🔒 **1. Principles to Follow**

* **Environment Isolation**: Never allow direct Dev access to Prod systems.
* **Controlled Transfer**: Pull data from Prod via intermediaries or APIs with limited scope.
* **Auditability**: Log all file movement across environments.
* **Least Privilege**: Use the minimum access needed for the transfer.

---

## 🧱 **2. Design Pattern Overview**

```
Prod → Controlled Export Node → Sanitization → Dev
```

---

### ✅ **3. Steps to Implement**

### Step 1: **Export Node or Drop Zone in Prod**

* Set up a **Kiteworks shared folder** (or SFTP drop-zone) in Prod for export.
* Only certain Prod users/applications can **write to** this folder.
* Example: `/export/dev-dumps/`

### Step 2: **Automation for Export**

* Use a **scheduled job** or **event-triggered workflow** in Prod to:

  * Sanitize or redact sensitive info (if needed).
  * Package and push data to the shared folder.
  * Apply retention (e.g., delete after 7 days).

### Step 3: **Intermediary Secure Account or Gateway**

* Create a **“Transfer Account”** (service account) with read-only access to the Prod export folder.
* Use a **dedicated MFT gateway** (or intermediate file mover, such as a secure DMZ jump server) to:

  * Pull files from Prod export location.
  * Log and checksum them.
  * Transfer to a UAT-approved location in Dev.

### Step 4: **Inbound Folder in Dev**

* In Dev, configure a Kiteworks folder or internal SFTP server that accepts files only from the secure intermediary.
* Apply:

  * AV scanning.
  * Integrity check (hash validation).
  * Access control (only Dev leads can read).

### Step 5: **Monitoring & Alerts**

* Enable logging/auditing in Kiteworks for:

  * File access.
  * User activity.
  * File movement across environments.
* Set up email/SIEM alerts for cross-env file transfers.

---

## ⚙️ **4. Optional Enhancements**

* **Data Tokenization**: Replace sensitive values in the data before exporting from Prod.
* **Approval Workflow**: Use Kiteworks’ approval mechanism before files go to Dev.
* **Encryption at Rest + In Transit**: Ensure TLS + encryption policies are enforced throughout.
* **Immutable Logs**: Forward logs to a secure SIEM or log vault.

---

## ✋ **5. What *Not* to Do**

* ❌ Never give Dev users access to Prod folders.
* ❌ Don’t hardcode credentials for transfer – use vault-managed secrets or SSH keys.
* ❌ Don’t bypass logging/alerting – everything should be auditable.

## 📄 Example Policy in Kiteworks

```yaml
Policy:
  - Name: Cross-Env Transfer
    Source: /prod/export/dev-dumps/
    Destination: /dev/inbound/prod-data/
    Allowed Users: [svc-transfer]
    Time Window: "2am-4am UTC"
    Notification: On Transfer Success & Failure
    Retention: 7 days
```

## 🚀 Summary

| Element        | Approach                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Access Control | Use service account, never personal logins       |
| Transfer Path  | Prod Export → Intermediary → Dev Inbound         |
| Logs           | Enable end-to-end audit in Kiteworks             |
| Security       | Encryption, AV scan, and redaction if needed     |
| Automation     | Scheduled or triggered jobs, not manual movement |

Would you like help drafting a sample architecture diagram or shell script to automate this process?



Great — here’s a full solution including a **diagram description**, a **script example**, and a **high-level architecture** you can present or implement.

---

## 🧱 1. **Architecture Diagram Description**

We’ll walk through this verbally first — you can visualize or draw this later (or I can generate a diagram for you too).

### **ENVIRONMENTS**

```
        ┌─────────────┐                ┌────────────┐
        │   PROD MFT  │                │   DEV MFT  │
        │ (Kiteworks) │                │ (Kiteworks)│
        └─────┬───────┘                └─────┬──────┘
              │                                  │
        ┌─────▼─────┐                     ┌──────▼──────┐
        │ Export Dir│                     │  Import Dir │
        │ /export/dev│<────────┐   ┌──────│/import/prod │
        └────────────┘         │   │      └─────────────┘
                               ▼   ▼
                       ┌─────────────────┐
                       │ Intermediary VM │
                       │ (Secure Gateway)│
                       └─────────────────┘
```

**Roles:**

* **Prod MFT:** Hosts an export directory. Only app or automation writes here.
* **Intermediary VM:** Pulls from Prod, pushes to Dev. No users log in. Keys only.
* **Dev MFT:** Only receives — cannot push to Prod. Read-only access by dev team.

---

## ⚙️ 2. **Script for Intermediary File Transfer**

Assuming:

* You use `scp` or `sftp` with SSH keys.
* The intermediary has keys to access both environments.
* You’re transferring files with integrity checks.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# CONFIG
PROD_HOST="prod-kiteworks.example.com"
DEV_HOST="dev-kiteworks.example.com"
PROD_USER="svc_transfer"
DEV_USER="svc_transfer"
EXPORT_DIR="/export/dev-dumps/"
IMPORT_DIR="/import/prod-files/"
TMP_DIR="/tmp/kiteworks-transfer"
SSH_KEY="/opt/keys/kiteworks_transfer.key"

# STEP 1: Create working dir
mkdir -p "$TMP_DIR"
cd "$TMP_DIR" || exit 1

# STEP 2: Pull files from PROD
scp -i "$SSH_KEY" "${PROD_USER}@${PROD_HOST}:${EXPORT_DIR}*" .

# STEP 3: Verify integrity (basic check — improve with hash if needed)
for file in *; do
  if [[ -f "$file" ]]; then
    echo "Transferring: $file"
    
    # STEP 4: Push to DEV
    scp -i "$SSH_KEY" "$file" "${DEV_USER}@${DEV_HOST}:${IMPORT_DIR}"
    
    if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then
      echo "Success: $file"
    else
      echo "FAILED: $file"
    fi
  fi
done

# STEP 5: Clean up
rm -rf "$TMP_DIR"
```

You can make this script run on a **cron schedule** or triggered by an API/event.

## 🔐 3. **Security Controls to Enforce**

| Area           | Control                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Authentication | Use SSH keys (rotate every 90 days)        |
| Transfer Host  | Hardened Linux VM with no user login       |
| Logs           | Send to centralized SIEM (Splunk, etc.)    |
| File Retention | Auto-delete after X days                   |
| Permissions    | RO on source, RW on dest, no bidirectional |
| Sanitization   | Use a pre-transfer job in Prod if needed   |

---

## 📄 4. Optional Audit Logging Script

Add this to the script to log each event to a file or syslog:

```bash
LOG_FILE="/var/log/kiteworks-transfer.log"
echo "$(date): Transferred $file from $PROD_HOST to $DEV_HOST" >> "$LOG_FILE"
```
