To securely allow your **Dev environment** to access files from **Prod** in your **on-prem Kiteworks Managed File Transfer (MFT)** setup, you need a **segregated, auditable, and policy-controlled** design. Here's a secure and scalable design approach:

---

## üîí **1. Principles to Follow**

* **Environment Isolation**: Never allow direct Dev access to Prod systems.
* **Controlled Transfer**: Pull data from Prod via intermediaries or APIs with limited scope.
* **Auditability**: Log all file movement across environments.
* **Least Privilege**: Use the minimum access needed for the transfer.

---

## üß± **2. Design Pattern Overview**

```
Prod ‚Üí Controlled Export Node ‚Üí Sanitization ‚Üí Dev
```

---

### ‚úÖ **3. Steps to Implement**

### Step 1: **Export Node or Drop Zone in Prod**

* Set up a **Kiteworks shared folder** (or SFTP drop-zone) in Prod for export.
* Only certain Prod users/applications can **write to** this folder.
* Example: `/export/dev-dumps/`

### Step 2: **Automation for Export**

* Use a **scheduled job** or **event-triggered workflow** in Prod to:

  * Sanitize or redact sensitive info (if needed).
  * Package and push data to the shared folder.
  * Apply retention (e.g., delete after 7 days).

### Step 3: **Intermediary Secure Account or Gateway**

* Create a **‚ÄúTransfer Account‚Äù** (service account) with read-only access to the Prod export folder.
* Use a **dedicated MFT gateway** (or intermediate file mover, such as a secure DMZ jump server) to:

  * Pull files from Prod export location.
  * Log and checksum them.
  * Transfer to a UAT-approved location in Dev.

### Step 4: **Inbound Folder in Dev**

* In Dev, configure a Kiteworks folder or internal SFTP server that accepts files only from the secure intermediary.
* Apply:

  * AV scanning.
  * Integrity check (hash validation).
  * Access control (only Dev leads can read).

### Step 5: **Monitoring & Alerts**

* Enable logging/auditing in Kiteworks for:

  * File access.
  * User activity.
  * File movement across environments.
* Set up email/SIEM alerts for cross-env file transfers.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **4. Optional Enhancements**

* **Data Tokenization**: Replace sensitive values in the data before exporting from Prod.
* **Approval Workflow**: Use Kiteworks‚Äô approval mechanism before files go to Dev.
* **Encryption at Rest + In Transit**: Ensure TLS + encryption policies are enforced throughout.
* **Immutable Logs**: Forward logs to a secure SIEM or log vault.

---

## ‚úã **5. What *Not* to Do**

* ‚ùå Never give Dev users access to Prod folders.
* ‚ùå Don‚Äôt hardcode credentials for transfer ‚Äì use vault-managed secrets or SSH keys.
* ‚ùå Don‚Äôt bypass logging/alerting ‚Äì everything should be auditable.

## üìÑ Example Policy in Kiteworks

```yaml
Policy:
  - Name: Cross-Env Transfer
    Source: /prod/export/dev-dumps/
    Destination: /dev/inbound/prod-data/
    Allowed Users: [svc-transfer]
    Time Window: "2am-4am UTC"
    Notification: On Transfer Success & Failure
    Retention: 7 days
```

## üöÄ Summary

| Element        | Approach                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Access Control | Use service account, never personal logins       |
| Transfer Path  | Prod Export ‚Üí Intermediary ‚Üí Dev Inbound         |
| Logs           | Enable end-to-end audit in Kiteworks             |
| Security       | Encryption, AV scan, and redaction if needed     |
| Automation     | Scheduled or triggered jobs, not manual movement |
