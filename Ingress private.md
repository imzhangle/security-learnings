Yes, in OpenShift, **internal ingress** (or internal routes) can be configured to **only be accessible within the cluster or from a private/internal network**, effectively restricting access to internal services only. This is commonly used for services that should not be exposed externally (e.g., internal APIs, databases, admin panels, etc.).

---

### âœ… How to Have OpenShift Internal Ingress Only for Local Services

There are **multiple ways** to configure internal-only access depending on your ingress controller and routing setup.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Option 1: Use a Custom IngressController with Internal Visibility

### Steps:

1. **Create a new IngressController** (if using OpenShift 4.x with OpenShift Router/IngressOperator).

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: IngressController
metadata:
  name: internal
  namespace: openshift-ingress-operator
spec:
  domain: internal.example.com
  replicas: 2
  endpointPublishingStrategy:
    type: LoadBalancerService
    loadBalancer:
      scope: Internal  # <-- This is the key
```

This sets up a load balancer with **internal scope only**, meaning it's not exposed to the public internet.

2. **Wait for the internal router to be ready** (in the `openshift-ingress` namespace).

3. **Create routes** with that domain:

```yaml
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: my-internal-service
  namespace: my-namespace
  labels:
    router: internal  # Optional, but useful for tracking
spec:
  host: my-internal-service.internal.example.com
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: my-service
  tls:
    termination: edge
  wildcardPolicy: None
```

4. **Access it from internal services** using DNS inside the cluster or from your private network if your VPC/subnet allows access to internal load balancer IPs.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Option 2: Use ClusterIP Services Only (No Route)

If your services do not need HTTP routing and are only accessed by other services in-cluster:

* Just use `ClusterIP` services (default type).
* Other pods can access them by service name (e.g., `http://my-service.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local`).
* No ingress controller or route needed.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Option 3: Internal Route Using NetworkPolicy (For Fine-Grained Access)

1. Create a **Route** normally, but **restrict who can talk to the backing service** using a `NetworkPolicy`:

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-from-local
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-service
  ingress:
    - from:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app: allowed-app
```

This doesn't hide the route externally, but it prevents unauthorized access.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Option 4: Annotate the Route for Internal-Only Exposure

If your OpenShift environment uses AWS/GCP/Azure LoadBalancers, some environments allow internal-only exposure via annotations on the route or service.

Example (AWS):

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-internal: "true"
```

> This only works if your ingress controller honors this annotation and your cloud provider supports internal load balancers.

---

## ðŸ”Ž How to Access Internal Ingress

* **From another pod**: Use the internal DNS name (`<route-hostname>`, or `<service>.<namespace>.svc`).
* **From your local machine**:

  * Use `oc port-forward` if needed.
  * Or, if you have internal network access (VPN / VPC peer), resolve and connect to the internal domain.

Example:

```bash
curl http://my-internal-service.internal.example.com
```

> Fails externally, but works from internal systems (including other pods or nodes).

---

## âœ… Best Practices

* Donâ€™t expose internal-only services via the default/public ingress controller.
* Use `NetworkPolicy` or `ServiceAccount` scoping to further restrict access.
* Use **cluster DNS** for internal service discovery instead of Routes if HTTP routing is not necessary.
