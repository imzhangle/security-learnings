Excellent and practical question üëç ‚Äî let‚Äôs unpack that carefully.

---

## üß† Short Answer

üëâ **No ‚Äî clients do *not* connect directly to the Node IP.**
Clients should connect through either:

* the **SCAN name (preferred)**, or
* the **VIP** (in older setups or specific cases).

---

## üß© Here‚Äôs Why

### 1. **Client Connection Path**

When a client issues an SQL query (say via SQL*Plus or an application), it connects like this:

```
Client ‚Üí SCAN Listener ‚Üí Node Listener ‚Üí Database Instance
```

So the flow is:

1. Client connects to **SCAN IP** (resolves to one of the 3 SCAN listeners).
2. The SCAN listener checks cluster load and redirects the connection to:

   * the **VIP** of the target node, and then
   * the **local listener** on that node.

At no point does the client need the **Node IP**.

---

### 2. **Why Not Node IP?**

* **Node IP** is meant for **OS-level access** (like SSH, patching, etc.), not database client traffic.
* It **does not fail over** ‚Äî so if the node goes down, clients connecting to that IP will hang.
* Using Node IP breaks **RAC‚Äôs high availability** and **load balancing** mechanisms.

### 3. **When the VIP Matters**

If SCAN is not used (older RAC setups, pre-11gR2), you can still define multiple VIPs in the connection string, e.g.:

```bash
(DESCRIPTION=
  (ADDRESS_LIST=
    (ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=node1-vip.mydomain.com)(PORT=1521))
    (ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=node2-vip.mydomain.com)(PORT=1521))
  )
  (CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=orcl))
)
```

This setup allows failover via VIPs, though **SCAN is the modern and recommended** approach.

---

### 4. **Network Flow Visualization**

```
Client
   ‚îÇ
   ‚ñº
SCAN Listener (on SCAN IP)
   ‚îÇ   -- load balancing / redirection
   ‚ñº
Node Listener (on VIP)
   ‚îÇ
   ‚ñº
Database Instance
```

---

‚úÖ **So to summarize:**

| Connection Type | Used by Client            | Purpose                           | Moves on Failover |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Node IP**     | ‚ùå No                      | OS-level access                   | ‚ùå No              |
| **VIP**         | ‚öôÔ∏è Older or manual setups | Client connections, fast failover | ‚úÖ Yes             |
| **SCAN IP**     | ‚úÖ Preferred (modern)      | Single entry point, load balance  | ‚úÖ Yes             |

If you want, I can show you **a step-by-step example of what ports/IPs you must open in the firewall** to let SQL clients connect correctly through SCAN or VIP.
Would you like me to show that next?
