Great question! You want to **check if your GitHub token is a JWT** and **inspect its contents** (like the `key_id` or other fields). However, due to security restrictions in GitHub Actions, **you cannot directly print or decode `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`** ‚Äî but let‚Äôs clarify what kind of token it is and how you can work with **your own** tokens safely.

---

### üîç 1. Is `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` a JWT?

**Yes ‚Äî but only sometimes.**

- ‚úÖ **GitHub App tokens** (generated from a GitHub App) are **JWT-based**.
- ‚ùå **`secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`** (the default one provided by GitHub Actions) is **not a standard JWT** ‚Äî it's an **OAuth2 token** (a scoped, short-lived access token), not a JSON Web Token.

So:
```yaml
${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}  # ‚Üí Not a JWT. It's an OAuth access token.
```

But if you're using a **GitHub App**, and you generate a token via JWT + App ID + Private Key, **that** token **is** a JWT.

---

### üß™ How to Check if a Token is a JWT

A JWT has the format: `xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz` ‚Äî three base64-encoded parts separated by dots.

You can test this in a script:

```yaml
- name: Check if token is JWT
  env:
    MY_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.MY_GITHUB_TOKEN }}  # Your custom token
  run: |
    # Extract first part (header) and check if it's JWT-like
    if [[ "$MY_TOKEN" == *\.*\.*\.* ]]; then
      echo "Token appears to be a JWT (has 3 parts)"
      
      # Decode JWT header (first part)
      HEADER=$(echo "$MY_TOKEN" | cut -d'.' -f1)
      DECODED_HEADER=$(echo "$HEADER" | base64 -d 2>/dev/null || echo "$HEADER (base64 decode failed)")
      echo "JWT Header: $DECODED_HEADER"

      # Look for 'kid' (key ID) in header
      if echo "$DECODED_HEADER" | grep -q "kid"; then
        KEY_ID=$(echo "$DECODED_HEADER" | grep -o '"kid":"[^"]*"' || echo "Not found")
        echo "Found key_id: $KEY_ID"
      else
        echo "No 'kid' field in JWT header"
      fi
    else
      echo "Token is NOT a JWT (likely an OAuth token)"
    fi
```

> üîí Note: GitHub will **mask the token value** in logs, but the **result of operations** (like decoded header) may still be visible **if the secret value is not echoed directly**.

‚ö†Ô∏è However, if the raw token appears anywhere in output, GitHub **will mask it** as `***`.

---

### ‚úÖ Safe Way: Test Locally

To inspect a token safely, **do not use secrets in GitHub Actions**. Instead:

#### 1. Use a test script **locally**:
```bash
TOKEN="your.github.token.here"

# Check if JWT
if [[ "$TOKEN" == *\.*\.*\.* ]]; then
  echo "‚úÖ Likely a JWT"
  
  # Decode header (first part)
  HEADER=$(echo "${TOKEN%%.*.*}" | base64 -d 2>/dev/null)
  echo "Header: $HEADER"

  # Extract kid (key ID)
  KEY_ID=$(echo "$HEADER" | grep -o '"kid":"[^"]*"' | cut -d'"' -f4)
  if [ -n "$KEY_ID" ]; then
    echo "üîë Key ID (kid): $KEY_ID"
  else
    echo "No kid in token"
  fi
else
  echo "‚ùå Not a JWT"
fi
```

Run this **on your local machine**, not in GitHub Actions.

### üß© When Do You Get a JWT?

You generate a JWT when:
1. You have a **GitHub App**
2. You create a JWT using:
   - `iss` (App ID)
   - `iat`, `exp`
   - Signed with the **private key (.pem file)**

Then you use that JWT to request an **installation access token**:
```http
POST /app/installations/{id}/access_tokens
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt>
```

That returned token is the one you use for API calls ‚Äî and **that** is an OAuth token, not a JWT.

### ‚úÖ Summary

| Question | Answer |
|--------|--------|
| Is `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` a JWT? | ‚ùå No ‚Äî it's an OAuth2 token |
| Can I decode a token in GitHub Actions? | ‚ö†Ô∏è Only if it's **not a secret** ‚Äî otherwise masked |
| Can I see the `kid` (key ID) from a JWT? | ‚úÖ Yes ‚Äî if you decode the **first part** of the JWT |
| Best way to inspect a token? | üîê Do it **locally** with a script, not in Actions |

### üí° Pro Tip
If you're using a **GitHub App**, the `kid` (key ID) comes from the **App's private key** ‚Äî and you can find it in:
- The JWT payload: `"iss":"APP_ID"`, and
- The header: `"kid":"HEX_STRING"` ‚Äî which matches your private key

You can also get `kid` from the `.pem` file:
```bash
openssl rsa -in app-key.pem -pubout -outform DER 2>/dev/null | openssl sha256 -binary | xxd -p -c 30
```

This hash is the `kid`.
