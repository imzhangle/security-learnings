Based on your full context:

* You have an **on-prem OpenShift cluster** behind an **F5 VIP**.
* TLS can be **terminated at the Ingress Router** (HAProxy), or **passed through** to backend services.
* You use a **wildcard certificate** at ingress.
* Regardless of approach, **backend services require TLS certificates with exclusive DNS names in the SAN**.
* The trust between **Ingress and Backend** must be explicitly configured (i.e., **Ingress must trust backend certs**).
* You're interested in how these factors affect **operational complexity, performance, security, and observability**.

## üîÑ **Comparison: Re-encrypt at Ingress vs Passthrough TLS**

| **Category**                          | **Re-encrypt at Ingress**                                                     | **TLS Passthrough**                                                           |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **TLS Termination**                   | Terminated at Ingress, re-established to backend                              | End-to-end TLS from client to backend                                         |
| **Certificate at Ingress**            | ‚úÖ Wildcard cert (e.g., `*.apps.example.com`)                                  | ‚úÖ Wildcard cert (used only for routing via SNI)                               |
| **Backend TLS Certs**                 | ‚ùó Required, must match backend DNS (SAN)                                      | ‚ùó Required, must match backend DNS (SAN)                                      |
| **Ingress Trust**                     | ‚ùó Must trust the backend cert (via `destinationCACertificate`)                | ‚ùå Ingress doesn‚Äôt terminate, no trust required                                |
| **Routing Capabilities**              | ‚úÖ Full HTTP and SNI routing (host + path)                                     | ‚ùå SNI-based routing only                                                      |
| **HTTP Observability (metrics/logs)** | ‚úÖ Full: request logs, HTTP metrics, OpenShift route telemetry                 | ‚ùå None: TLS traffic is opaque                                                 |
| **Cert Management Complexity**        | ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium: Wildcard at ingress; backend certs needed, Ingress must trust them | ‚ùó High: Backend certs still needed, but no central control or trust injection |
| **Security (TLS Scope)**              | ‚úÖ Secure: double TLS; Ingress verifies backend                                | ‚úÖ Secure: client verifies backend directly                                    |
| **End-to-End TLS**                    | ‚úÖ Yes (via re-encrypt), but with intermediate termination                     | ‚úÖ Yes, strict end-to-end (no termination)                                     |
| **Performance**                       | ‚ö†Ô∏è Slight CPU/memory overhead (double TLS handshake)                          | ‚úÖ Lower latency, no extra TLS processing at Ingress                           |
| **Troubleshooting**                   | ‚úÖ Easier (HAProxy logs errors, can inspect)                                   | ‚ùå Harder (no visibility into app-level issues)                                |
| **Backend Cert Rotation Risk**        | ‚ö†Ô∏è Fails if Ingress can‚Äôt verify cert or SAN mismatch                         | ‚ùó Fails if client can‚Äôt verify backend; harder to debug                       |
| **Best Fit Use Case**                 | ‚úÖ When you want routing, observability, and centralized control               | ‚úÖ When you need strict zero-trust and no intermediate termination             |

## üß† Key Takeaways

* **Re-encrypt is more manageable and observable**, especially with OpenShift‚Äôs built-in **Service CA**:

  * Backend certs with SAN can be auto-injected.
  * Ingress can trust the Service CA via `destinationCACertificate`.
  * Enables centralized routing, logs, metrics, and TLS security.

* **Passthrough is cleaner in theory** (true end-to-end TLS), but in practice:

  * Adds significant cert management overhead.
  * Lacks visibility.
  * Limits routing capabilities (no path-based routing, just SNI).

## ‚úÖ Final Recommendation (for most on-prem OpenShift use cases)

| Feature                                                                | Recommendation                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Best balance of **security, manageability, observability**             | ‚úÖ **Re-encrypt TLS at Ingress**                |
| Required for **strict end-to-end client TLS with no trust in Ingress** | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Passthrough**, but expect cert complexity |

If you're okay with the Ingress verifying backend certs (which is fully secure with the right CA trust setup), **re-encrypt is strongly preferred** for operational sanity.

Let me know if you want automation examples for backend certs via Service CA or cert-manager.
