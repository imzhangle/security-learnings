Excellent — reviewing **batch ingestion and egression** (data movement between on-prem systems and Adobe Experience Platform, or AEP) is a critical part of your data security and compliance architecture.

Let’s break this review into a structured **security architecture assessment framework**, focusing on both **ingress (to AEP)** and **egress (from AEP)**.

---

## 🔐 1. Overview of Batch Ingestion & Egression

**Batch Ingestion**

* Movement of data from **on-premises data stores** (e.g., SQL, Hadoop, S3-compatible, etc.) → **Adobe Experience Platform (AEP)**.
* Usually occurs through **Adobe Experience Platform Data Ingestion APIs**, **Adobe Experience Platform Source Connectors**, or **custom batch upload via Adobe I/O / SFTP / APIs**.

**Batch Egression**

* Movement of data from **AEP → on-premises systems** (e.g., for analytics, BI, ML pipelines, or regulatory storage).
* Happens via **Destination connectors**, **Adobe Real-Time CDP exports**, **batch download APIs**, or **SFTP destinations**.

## ⚙️ 2. Architecture Review Areas

### A. Data Flow Identification

* Map all **data entry/exit points** between AEP and on-prem.
* Identify **protocols**, **transfer methods**, **authentication mechanisms**, and **storage endpoints**.
* Document whether transfers are **push** (initiated by on-prem) or **pull** (initiated by AEP).

Example data flow:

```
On-prem ETL --> Secure transfer zone (SFTP/Azure Blob) --> AEP Batch Ingestion API
AEP Batch Egress --> Adobe-managed SFTP --> On-prem ingestion
```

### B. Security Controls for Batch Ingestion

| Control Area            | Key Checks                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Transport Security**  | All ingestion traffic must use **TLS 1.2+** with strong ciphers. For SFTP, enforce **SSH key authentication**.                     |
| **Authentication**      | Use **Adobe IMS (Identity Management System)** with **OAuth 2.0** or **JWT-based service accounts**. Avoid user-based credentials. |
| **Encryption at Rest**  | Verify that source data and staging buckets are **AES-256 encrypted** (Adobe manages encryption at rest by default).               |
| **Data Validation**     | Validate schema, data quality, and personally identifiable information (PII) handling before ingestion.                            |
| **Data Classification** | Ensure sensitive data fields are tagged appropriately for AEP governance and privacy rules.                                        |
| **Audit Logging**       | Enable logs for every upload job (e.g., ingestion job ID, timestamp, user/service account).                                        |

### C. Security Controls for Batch Egression

| Control Area               | Key Checks                                                                                              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Access Control**         | Egress should only be permitted to **authorized destinations**. Apply **principle of least privilege**. |
| **Data Minimization**      | Export only necessary fields. Use AEP **Data Access Control Policies** to enforce this.                 |
| **Encryption in Transit**  | Require TLS/SFTP with key-based authentication for downloads or destination exports.                    |
| **Data Handling on-prem**  | Validate that data landing zones have **at-rest encryption** and **restricted access**.                 |
| **Retention and Deletion** | Define retention policies post-egress; confirm AEP and on-prem data lifecycle alignment.                |
| **Audit and Monitoring**   | Log data exports, destinations, file hashes, and user/service account identities.                       |

---

### D. Governance & Compliance

* Ensure **AEP Data Governance labels** and **usage policies** (marketing, analytics, export restrictions) are implemented.
* Validate compliance with **GDPR**, **CCPA**, **HIPAA** (if applicable).
* Verify **data residency** requirements — some AEP regions are restricted.
* Maintain **Data Processing Agreements (DPAs)** with Adobe and any third-party transfer partners.

### E. Threat Modeling

**Potential Threats**

| Threat                                          | Mitigation                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Data exfiltration via misconfigured destination | Role-based access controls, destination whitelisting         |
| Man-in-the-middle interception                  | TLS 1.2+, certificate pinning                                |
| Credential compromise                           | Use short-lived tokens, rotate keys, store in secret vault   |
| Misuse of PII                                   | Apply AEP data governance labels, restrict exports           |
| Incomplete or failed transfer                   | Use checksum validation and error handling in ingestion jobs |

---

### F. Operational Recommendations

* Implement **automated job validation** (checksums, row counts).
* Set up **SIEM integration** for Adobe audit logs.
* Periodically review **service accounts, API keys, and OAuth tokens**.
* Schedule **quarterly access reviews** for AEP projects and destinations.
* Define **incident response procedures** for data transfer failures or suspected breaches.

### G. Documentation & Deliverables

Your review should produce:

1. **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** – showing batch ingress/egress paths.
2. **Security Control Matrix** – mapping controls to NIST 800-53 / ISO 27001 / SOC2.
3. **Risk Register** – listing residual risks with likelihood and impact.
4. **Recommendations Report** – prioritized list of control improvements.

Would you like me to draft a **security architecture review template** (Word/Excel format) for you to fill in for your Adobe Experience Platform batch processes?
It can include sections for architecture diagrams, control validation, risk assessment, and approval sign-off.
