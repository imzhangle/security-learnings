## üß© When Are They *Complementary*?

While mostly concurrent, there are **some areas where one might complement another**, especially when building a full-stack solution:

| Use Case | Best Fit | Could Be Complemented By |
|----------|----------|---------------------------|
| **Quick Integration Without Coding** | Appdome | Build38 or Digital.ai for deeper protections |
| **Secure Communication Layer (TLS+, SEAL)** | Build38 | Digital.ai for code-level protection |

## üéØ Strategic Recommendation

Depending on your priorities:

| If You Need... | Recommended Vendor | Why |
|----------------|---------------------|-----|
| **Fast, no-code implementation** | Appdome | Easy to integrate without deep dev involvement |
| **Deep code protection + runtime defense** | Digital.ai | Industry leader in runtime integrity and obfuscation |
| **Secure comms + fraud integration (especially in EU fintech)** | Build38 | Strong in Germany/EU, integrates well with fraud engines like BioCatch |

You can even consider using **two of them together**, e.g.:

- Use **Appdome** for quick integration of basic protections
- Add **Digital.ai** or **Build38** for deeper runtime/code-level protections

However, this could lead to **overlapping features** and increased app complexity, so it's best to pick **one primary vendor** unless you have a very specific reason to combine.

## üß© Strategic Recommendation

As a **Security Architect**, your goal is not just to evaluate each tool individually, but to **integrate them into a layered defense model**:

### üîê Layered Defense Strategy

| Layer | Recommended Tool |
|-------|------------------|
| **Mobile App Framework** | Horizon Mobile Banking |
| **App Hardening** | Digital.ai Application Protection |
| **User Behavior Monitoring** | BioCatch |
| **Backend API Security** | ODS (Open Digital Service), OAuth2 provider |
| **Monitoring & Logging** | SIEM (Splunk, QRadar) + vendor dashboards |

---

## üìÑ Bonus: RFP Template Snippet

If you're preparing an **RFP** or internal evaluation document, here‚Äôs a sample question format:

> **Question:** Please describe how your platform supports OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS) Level 2.
>
> **Expected Answer Format:**  
> - List of verified controls  
> - Attestation or certification status  
> - Sample implementation guidance

Would you like me to help draft a full **RFP template**, **evaluation matrix (Excel or PDF)**, or even a **vendor comparison presentation** based on this?


### üîê What Is **Secure Communication Layer Depth**?

**Secure Communication Layer Depth** refers to the **number of security-enhanced layers and mechanisms** used in the communication between a mobile app (or client) and a backend server.

In simple terms:
> It‚Äôs how **deeply encrypted, authenticated, and protected** the data is as it travels across the network ‚Äî especially from threats like:
> - Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks
> - Session hijacking
> - Certificate pinning bypasses
> - Network-level tampering

---

## üß† Why Does "Layer Depth" Matter?

In high-security environments like **Open Banking**, **financial apps**, or **enterprise mobile apps**, **standard TLS/SSL** may not be enough because:

- Attackers can sometimes bypass standard certificate pinning using tools like **Burp Suite**, **Frida**, or **rooted devices**.
- Standard TLS doesn‚Äôt always verify the **integrity of the client app itself** during communication.
- There's no **session-specific encryption** or **device integrity validation** built into the protocol.

That‚Äôs where **deep secure communication layers** come in ‚Äî they add **custom, proprietary protections** on top of standard TLS to make network communication **far more resilient** to these advanced attacks.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Components That Contribute to Secure Communication Layer Depth

Here are key features that indicate **deeper secure communication capabilities**:

| Feature | Description | Increases Depth? |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **Standard TLS/SSL** | Basic HTTPS communication | ‚ùå (Baseline) |
| **Certificate Pinning** | Ensures only trusted certificates are accepted | ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate |
| **Custom Encryption Layer** | Adds an extra layer beyond TLS (e.g., SEAL by Build38) | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Session Token Binding** | Binds API calls to session tokens for replay protection | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Device Integrity Check During Comm** | Validates the app hasn't been tampered with before allowing communication | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Runtime MITM Detection** | Detects if a proxy or attacker is intercepting traffic | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Dynamic Key Exchange** | Uses runtime-generated keys instead of static ones | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Anti-Replay Protection** | Prevents reuse of intercepted requests | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Custom Transport Protocol** | Uses a non-standard transport layer (not just HTTP/HTTPS) | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Integration with Fraud Engines** | Communicates device risk score to backend | ‚úÖ Yes |

---

## üîç Examples of Vendors with Deep vs. Shallow Layer Depth

| Vendor | Secure Comm Layer Depth | Description |
|--------|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Build38 (SEAL)** | ‚úÖ Deep | Proprietary SEAL layer adds encryption, integrity checks, and fraud integration; used in EU fintech |
| **Digital.ai** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate | Strong code obfuscation, includes TLS pinning but no custom protocol |
| **Appdome** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate | Offers TLS pinning and WAF, but no deep custom layer |
| **Custom App with OWASP MASVS L2+** | ‚úÖ Deep (if implemented) | Can include all depth features but requires expert development |

---

## üß© Real-World Example: Build38 SEAL

**SEAL (Secure Execution & Attack Localization)** by Build38 is a great example of **deep secure communication**.

It does the following:
- Wraps communication in a **custom protocol** on top of TLS
- Embeds **device attestation** into every request
- Provides **runtime MITM detection**
- Supports **dynamic key exchange**
- Integrates with fraud engines like BioCatch

This makes it **much harder for attackers** to inspect or manipulate API traffic ‚Äî even if they control the device.

---

## üìä Summary Table

| Level of Depth | Features Included | Use Case |
|----------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Shallow** | TLS + basic pinning | General-purpose apps |
| **Moderate** | TLS + pinning + WAF | Mid-tier enterprise apps |
| **Deep** | Custom protocol + runtime checks + fraud integration | Open Banking, fintech, regulated apps |

---

## üéØ When You Should Care About Secure Communication Layer Depth

You should care about **secure communication layer depth** when:

- You're in a **regulated industry** (e.g., finance, healthcare)
- Your app handles **sensitive data** (e.g., payments, PII)
- You must comply with standards like:
  - **PSD2 RTS**
  - **OWASP MASVS L2+**
  - **ISO 27001**
- You want to protect against **advanced reverse engineering or MITM attacks**

---

Would you like me to help you:
- Create a **secure communication architecture diagram**?
- Draft a **vendor evaluation checklist** based on layer depth?
- Compare vendors like Build38 SEAL vs. Digital.ai vs. Appdome in detail?
