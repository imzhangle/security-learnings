## üß© When Are They *Complementary*?

While mostly concurrent, there are **some areas where one might complement another**, especially when building a full-stack solution:

| Use Case | Best Fit | Could Be Complemented By |
|----------|----------|---------------------------|
| **Quick Integration Without Coding** | Appdome | Build38 or Digital.ai for deeper protections |
| **Secure Communication Layer (TLS+, SEAL)** | Build38 | Digital.ai for code-level protection |
| **Enterprise-Grade Protection (code-level + runtime)** | Digital.ai | Appdome for faster integration or DevOps automation |
| **Fraud Detection Integration** | Build38 (native integration with fraud engines) | BioCatch or other behavioral tools |

---

## üìä Summary Table

| Aspect | Concurrent? | Complementary? |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Core App Hardening Features** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| **Integration Method (SDK vs No-code)** | ‚úÖ Yes (different approaches) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially |
| **Secure Communication (e.g., SEAL)** | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes (Build38 complements others) |
| **Fraud Engine Integration** | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes (Build38 offers more native support) |
| **DevOps Automation / CI/CD Friendly** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Varies | ‚úÖ Appdome is easier to automate |
| **Open Banking / Financial Services Use Case** | ‚úÖ All are strong | ‚ö†Ô∏è Build38 has edge in EU fintech adoption |

---

## üéØ Strategic Recommendation

Depending on your priorities:

| If You Need... | Recommended Vendor | Why |
|----------------|---------------------|-----|
| **Fast, no-code implementation** | Appdome | Easy to integrate without deep dev involvement |
| **Deep code protection + runtime defense** | Digital.ai | Industry leader in runtime integrity and obfuscation |
| **Secure comms + fraud integration (especially in EU fintech)** | Build38 | Strong in Germany/EU, integrates well with fraud engines like BioCatch |

You can even consider using **two of them together**, e.g.:

- Use **Appdome** for quick integration of basic protections
- Add **Digital.ai** or **Build38** for deeper runtime/code-level protections

However, this could lead to **overlapping features** and increased app complexity, so it's best to pick **one primary vendor** unless you have a very specific reason to combine.
