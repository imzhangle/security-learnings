Excellent question!

Let’s dive into **how Build38 achieves its advanced TLS capabilities** through its proprietary **SEAL (Secure Execution & Attack Localization)** protocol.

---

## 🔐 TL;DR: How Build38 Achieves Enhanced TLS Security

Build38 enhances standard TLS communication by introducing a **custom secure communication layer called SEAL**, which adds:

1. **Device integrity checks**
2. **Runtime MITM detection**
3. **Session-specific encryption**
4. **Fraud engine integration**
5. **Enhanced certificate validation**

These are implemented via a **lightweight SDK**, with **no code changes required**, and work **transparently under the app's network stack**.

## 🧱 1. Build38 SEAL Architecture Overview

Here’s how Build38 integrates into your mobile app:

```
+---------------------+
|     Mobile App      |
| (OkHttp, NSURLSession) |
+----------+----------+
           |
           | Uses
           v
+----------+----------+
|   Build38 SEAL SDK  |
| (Transparent Proxy) |
+----------+----------+
           |
           | Wrapped in SEAL layer
           v
+----------+----------+
|    Standard TLS     |
| (HTTPS / TCP/IP)    |
+----------+----------+
           |
           | Communicates securely with
           v
+---------------------+
|     Backend API     |
| (e.g., ODS Gateway) |
+---------------------+
```

> 🔑 Key Point: SEAL sits **between the app and the OS networking stack**, wrapping all HTTP(S) traffic with additional security layers **without requiring any code changes**.

## 🔍 2. How Build38 SEAL Enhances TLS – Step-by-Step

### ✅ A. **Enhanced Certificate Validation**

#### What it does:
- Doesn’t rely solely on the device’s trusted CA store.
- Validates server certificates against **embedded trust anchors** inside the SDK.
- Supports **public key pinning**, **certificate pinning**, and **chain-of-trust verification**.

#### Why it matters:
- Prevents bypassing pinning via tools like Frida or Burp Suite.
- Even if the device is rooted/jailbroken, the app won’t accept a fake cert.

---

### ✅ B. **Device Integrity Binding**

#### What it does:
- Before allowing any network communication, SEAL verifies that:
  - The app hasn’t been tampered with (code integrity)
  - The device isn’t rooted or jailbroken
  - The app is running in a legitimate environment (not emulated or debugged)

#### Why it matters:
- Ensures only **untampered apps** can talk to your backend.
- Stops attackers from reverse-engineering the app and reusing logic for attacks.

---

### ✅ C. **Runtime MITM Detection**

#### What it does:
- Detects if someone is using a proxy tool (like Burp Suite) to intercept traffic.
- Monitors for signs of live interception:
  - Unexpected root certificates
  - Network anomalies
  - Device-level hooks (e.g., Frida)

#### Why it matters:
- Even if an attacker gets past pinning, SEAL blocks the request.
- Provides real-time protection during sessions — not just at startup.

---

### ✅ D. **Session-Specific Encryption**

#### What it does:
- Adds a **session-specific encryption layer** over TLS.
- Each session has a unique cryptographic context.
- Includes anti-replay protections.

#### Why it matters:
- Even if someone captures encrypted traffic, they can't reuse it.
- Makes replay attacks ineffective.

---

### ✅ E. **Fraud Engine Integration**

#### What it does:
- Integrates with fraud engines like **BioCatch**, **Feedzai**, or **Nice Actimize**.
- During each API call, SEAL sends a **device risk score** to the backend.
- If the risk score is high, the backend can reject the request.

#### Why it matters:
- Enables **real-time fraud detection** based on device behavior.
- Combines **network-layer security** with **user behavior analytics**.

---

### ✅ F. **No Code Changes Required**

#### How it works:
- Developers integrate the Build38 SDK into the app.
- No need to modify any networking code (works with OkHttp, URLSession, etc.).
- All enhancements happen automatically during runtime.

#### Why it matters:
- Fast deployment
- Reduces risk of developer error
- Easy to maintain across versions

## ⚙️ 3. Real-World Example: Intercepting Traffic

| Scenario | With Standard TLS + Pinning | With Build38 SEAL |
|---------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
| Attacker uses Burp Suite to intercept HTTPS traffic | ❌ Can bypass with Frida or root | ✅ Detected and blocked |
| App is decompiled and repackaged | ❌ Communication still possible | ✅ Blocked due to app integrity check |
| Device is rooted/jailbroken | ❌ May allow connection | ✅ SEAL blocks communication |
| Fake certificate installed | ❌ May bypass pinning | ✅ SEAL detects and rejects |
| Fraudster tries to replay transaction | ❌ Possible | ✅ SEAL prevents replay |
