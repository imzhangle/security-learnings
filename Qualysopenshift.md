Great question!

You're asking whether **Qualys** would detect or scan for specific **Kubernetes/OpenShift hardening practices**, such as:

1. Removing the default `kubeadmin` user.
2. Creating custom resources (CRs) to define identity mappings or roles.
3. Configuring an external identity provider (IdP) like LDAP, OIDC, etc.

Let‚Äôs go step-by-step and clarify what **Qualys can and cannot do** in this context.

## üîç Summary Up Front

| Action | Can Qualys Detect It? | How |
|-------|------------------------|-----|
| `kubeadmin` removed | ‚úÖ Yes (indirectly) |
| Custom resource created | ‚ùå No (unless you tell it) |
| Identity provider configured | ‚úÖ Yes (partially) |

---

## 1. üßπ Remove `kubeadmin`

### What is `kubeadmin`?
- A default administrative user created during OpenShift installation.
- Meant for initial cluster setup.
- Should be deleted after setting up a proper IdP and admin role.

### Can Qualys Detect This?

‚úÖ **Yes ‚Äì indirectly**, via compliance checks.

Qualys does not directly inspect your Kubernetes API server unless explicitly integrated with your clusters. However, you can detect this misconfiguration in two ways:

#### ‚úÖ Option A: Node-Level Compliance Check
If you're running Qualys on the control plane nodes (e.g., via agent or SSH-based scanning), you can check:
- If `/etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/kubeadmin/` still exists.
- If `kubeadmin` credentials file (`kubeadmin-password`) exists.

You can write a **custom policy check** in Qualys to look for these files and flag them as non-compliant.

#### ‚úÖ Option B: Use Compliance Operator + Export Results
OpenShift's **Compliance Operator** can run scans that include a check like:

> "Ensure `kubeadmin` password file has been removed"

Export those results and import them into Qualys manually or via API to track compliance.

---

## 2. üìÑ Create Custom Resources for Identity Mapping

### Example: Identity mapping CR
You might create a custom resource like:

```yaml
apiVersion: auth.example.com/v1
kind: GroupRoleMapping
metadata:
  name: dev-team
spec:
  identityProviderGroup: "dev-team@example.com"
  kubernetesRole: "edit"
```

This could be part of a homegrown or vendor-specific RBAC automation system.

### Can Qualys Detect This?

‚ùå **No ‚Äì Not natively.**

Qualys doesn't inspect custom Kubernetes resources unless:

- You expose their presence via node-level artifacts (e.g., config files).
- You build a **custom Qualys scanner script** to query the Kubernetes API.
- You use **Qualys Cloud Platform integrations** with Kubernetes APIs (limited).

#### ‚úÖ Workaround:
You can integrate Qualys with your CI/CD or GitOps tools (like ArgoCD) to validate that certain CRs exist in the repo or cluster.

Or, export the list of CRs from the cluster and upload to Qualys for manual review or ingestion.

---

## 3. üîê Configure External Identity Provider (IdP)

OpenShift supports external identity providers like:
- LDAP
- OIDC (e.g., Keycloak, Okta)
- GitHub
- HTpasswd

Configured via `OAuth` object in OpenShift:

```yaml
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: OAuth
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  identityProviders:
    - name: my-oidc
      type: OpenID
      openID:
        ...
```

### Can Qualys Detect This?

‚úÖ **Partially ‚Äì if you configure it properly.**

#### ‚úîÔ∏è Yes, if you scan the control plane node:
- The `OAuth` configuration is stored in static pods or managed by the platform.
- You can write a Qualys compliance rule to check:
  - If `/etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/configmaps/oauth-serving-cert/ca.crt` exists.
  - If any `htpasswd` files are present (bad practice).
  - If the OAuth configuration includes allowed identities.

#### ‚ùå No, if you only rely on remote vulnerability scanning:
- Qualys won‚Äôt know about internal IdP settings unless it can authenticate and query the OpenShift API (which is possible but requires integration).

## üîß Best Practices to Get These Scanned by Qualys

| Task | Recommended Method |
|------|---------------------|
| Detect `kubeadmin` removal | File system check via Qualys agent or SSH scanner |
| Ensure IdP is configured | Custom Qualys compliance rules checking config files |
| Verify custom resources exist | Manual export/upload or API integration |
| Score overall hardening | Combine compliance + vulnerability scan results in Qualys dashboard |

---

## üß™ Sample Qualys Policy Rule (for kubeadmin check)

Here's how you'd define a Qualys policy rule to detect leftover `kubeadmin` files:

```text
Title: Kubeadmin credentials should be removed after initial cluster setup
Description: The kubeadmin user and credentials should be removed after initial setup to avoid misuse.
Test Type: File Properties
Path: /etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/kubeadmin/
Expected Value: File/Folder does NOT exist
Result: Fail if found
```

---

## üì¶ Bonus: Use Compliance Operator & Sync with Qualys

You can use OpenShift‚Äôs **Compliance Operator** to generate reports like:

- CIS OpenShift Benchmark
- NIST SP 800-53
- DISA STIG

Then export results in SCAP format or CSV and:

- Upload to Qualys manually
- Automate using Qualys API

This gives you a **centralized view** of compliance across all systems ‚Äî including OpenShift hardening practices like removing `kubeadmin`.

## ‚úÖ Final Thoughts

| Practice | Can Qualys Scan It? | Notes |
|---------|----------------------|-------|
| Remove `kubeadmin` | ‚úÖ Yes (via file check or compliance operator) |
| Create custom resources | ‚ùå No (unless exported manually or via API) |
| Configure IdP | ‚úÖ Partially (via config file checks) |
| Hardening score | ‚úÖ Yes (by combining compliance + vuln data) |
