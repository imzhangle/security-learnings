Great question!

You're asking whether **Qualys** would detect or scan for specific **Kubernetes/OpenShift hardening practices**, such as:

1. Removing the default `kubeadmin` user.
2. Creating custom resources (CRs) to define identity mappings or roles.
3. Configuring an external identity provider (IdP) like LDAP, OIDC, etc.

Let‚Äôs go step-by-step and clarify what **Qualys can and cannot do** in this context.

---

## üîç Summary Up Front

| Action | Can Qualys Detect It? | How |
|-------|------------------------|-----|
| `kubeadmin` removed | ‚úÖ Yes (indirectly) |
| Custom resource created | ‚ùå No (unless you tell it) |
| Identity provider configured | ‚úÖ Yes (partially) |

---

## 1. üßπ Remove `kubeadmin`

### What is `kubeadmin`?
- A default administrative user created during OpenShift installation.
- Meant for initial cluster setup.
- Should be deleted after setting up a proper IdP and admin role.

### Can Qualys Detect This?

‚úÖ **Yes ‚Äì indirectly**, via compliance checks.

Qualys does not directly inspect your Kubernetes API server unless explicitly integrated with your clusters. However, you can detect this misconfiguration in two ways:

#### ‚úÖ Option A: Node-Level Compliance Check
If you're running Qualys on the control plane nodes (e.g., via agent or SSH-based scanning), you can check:
- If `/etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/kubeadmin/` still exists.
- If `kubeadmin` credentials file (`kubeadmin-password`) exists.

You can write a **custom policy check** in Qualys to look for these files and flag them as non-compliant.

#### ‚úÖ Option B: Use Compliance Operator + Export Results
OpenShift's **Compliance Operator** can run scans that include a check like:

> "Ensure `kubeadmin` password file has been removed"

Export those results and import them into Qualys manually or via API to track compliance.

---

## 2. üìÑ Create Custom Resources for Identity Mapping

### Example: Identity mapping CR
You might create a custom resource like:

```yaml
apiVersion: auth.example.com/v1
kind: GroupRoleMapping
metadata:
  name: dev-team
spec:
  identityProviderGroup: "dev-team@example.com"
  kubernetesRole: "edit"
```

This could be part of a homegrown or vendor-specific RBAC automation system.

### Can Qualys Detect This?

‚ùå **No ‚Äì Not natively.**

Qualys doesn't inspect custom Kubernetes resources unless:

- You expose their presence via node-level artifacts (e.g., config files).
- You build a **custom Qualys scanner script** to query the Kubernetes API.
- You use **Qualys Cloud Platform integrations** with Kubernetes APIs (limited).

#### ‚úÖ Workaround:
You can integrate Qualys with your CI/CD or GitOps tools (like ArgoCD) to validate that certain CRs exist in the repo or cluster.

Or, export the list of CRs from the cluster and upload to Qualys for manual review or ingestion.

---

## 3. üîê Configure External Identity Provider (IdP)

OpenShift supports external identity providers like:
- LDAP
- OIDC (e.g., Keycloak, Okta)
- GitHub
- HTpasswd

Configured via `OAuth` object in OpenShift:

```yaml
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: OAuth
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  identityProviders:
    - name: my-oidc
      type: OpenID
      openID:
        ...
```

### Can Qualys Detect This?

‚úÖ **Partially ‚Äì if you configure it properly.**

#### ‚úîÔ∏è Yes, if you scan the control plane node:
- The `OAuth` configuration is stored in static pods or managed by the platform.
- You can write a Qualys compliance rule to check:
  - If `/etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/configmaps/oauth-serving-cert/ca.crt` exists.
  - If any `htpasswd` files are present (bad practice).
  - If the OAuth configuration includes allowed identities.

#### ‚ùå No, if you only rely on remote vulnerability scanning:
- Qualys won‚Äôt know about internal IdP settings unless it can authenticate and query the OpenShift API (which is possible but requires integration).

---

## üîß Best Practices to Get These Scanned by Qualys

| Task | Recommended Method |
|------|---------------------|
| Detect `kubeadmin` removal | File system check via Qualys agent or SSH scanner |
| Ensure IdP is configured | Custom Qualys compliance rules checking config files |
| Verify custom resources exist | Manual export/upload or API integration |
| Score overall hardening | Combine compliance + vulnerability scan results in Qualys dashboard |

---

## üß™ Sample Qualys Policy Rule (for kubeadmin check)

Here's how you'd define a Qualys policy rule to detect leftover `kubeadmin` files:

```text
Title: Kubeadmin credentials should be removed after initial cluster setup
Description: The kubeadmin user and credentials should be removed after initial setup to avoid misuse.
Test Type: File Properties
Path: /etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/kubeadmin/
Expected Value: File/Folder does NOT exist
Result: Fail if found
```

---

## üì¶ Bonus: Use Compliance Operator & Sync with Qualys

You can use OpenShift‚Äôs **Compliance Operator** to generate reports like:

- CIS OpenShift Benchmark
- NIST SP 800-53
- DISA STIG

Then export results in SCAP format or CSV and:

- Upload to Qualys manually
- Automate using Qualys API

This gives you a **centralized view** of compliance across all systems ‚Äî including OpenShift hardening practices like removing `kubeadmin`.

---

## ‚úÖ Final Thoughts

| Practice | Can Qualys Scan It? | Notes |
|---------|----------------------|-------|
| Remove `kubeadmin` | ‚úÖ Yes (via file check or compliance operator) |
| Create custom resources | ‚ùå No (unless exported manually or via API) |
| Configure IdP | ‚úÖ Partially (via config file checks) |
| Hardening score | ‚úÖ Yes (by combining compliance + vuln data) |

The requirements listed in the image are related to hardening the **Controller Manager** component of Kubernetes/OpenShift. Let‚Äôs analyze whether these specific requirements can be scanned by **Qualys** and how you might approach this.

---

### üìù Key Requirements from the Image

#### 1. **Ensure that controller manager endpoints are protected by RBAC**
   - **Description**: Profiling endpoints should be secured via RBAC, restricting access to users with roles like `cluster-admin` or `cluster-debugger`.
   - **Recommended Value**: Secured via RBAC.

#### 2. **Ensure that the `--use-service-account-credentials` argument is set to `true`**
   - **Description**: The Controller Manager should use a dedicated service account for each control loop to minimize permissions.
   - **Recommended Value**: `--use-service-account-credentials: true`.

#### 3. **Ensure that the `--service-account-private-key-file` argument is set as appropriate**
   - **Description**: Service accounts should use a separate public/private key pair for signing tokens instead of relying on the default TLS certificate.
   - **Recommended Value**: Explicitly set a private key file.

#### 4. **Ensure that the `--root-ca-file` argument is set as appropriate**
   - **Description**: The API Server should use a separate CA bundle for service account tokens.
   - **Recommended Value**: `--root-ca-file: /etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/configmaps/serviceaccount-ca/ca-bundle.crt`.

#### 5. **Ensure that the `--bind-address` argument is set to `127.0.0.1`**
   - **Description**: The Controller Manager metrics endpoint should only bind to localhost to minimize attack surface.
   - **Recommended Value**: `--bind-address: 127.0.0.1`.

---

### üöÄ Can Qualys Scan These Requirements?

#### 1. **Ensure that controller manager endpoints are protected by RBAC**
   - **Scannable?**: **Partially**
   - **How?**
     - Qualys cannot directly inspect Kubernetes RBAC configurations unless it has access to the Kubernetes API server.
     - However, you can:
       - Use OpenShift's **Compliance Operator** to scan RBAC settings and export results to Qualys.
       - Write custom scripts to query the Kubernetes API (e.g., `kubectl get clusterroles`) and integrate those results into Qualys.
     - Alternatively, you can configure Qualys to check for the existence of certain RBAC rules on the nodes (e.g., checking `/etc/kubernetes/manifests` for static pods).

#### 2. **Ensure that the `--use-service-account-credentials` argument is set to `true`**
   - **Scannable?**: **Yes**
   - **How?**
     - This configuration is typically stored in the static pod manifest for the Controller Manager (`/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml`).
     - Qualys can scan the node filesystem to check if the `--use-service-account-credentials=true` flag is present in the manifest.
     - You can create a custom Qualys policy rule to look for this flag in the relevant YAML file.

#### 3. **Ensure that the `--service-account-private-key-file` argument is set as appropriate**
   - **Scannable?**: **Yes**
   - **How?**
     - The path to the private key file is specified in the Controller Manager static pod manifest.
     - Qualys can scan the node filesystem to verify that the `--service-account-private-key-file` flag points to an appropriate file.
     - Additionally, you can check if the file exists at the specified path and has the correct permissions.

#### 4. **Ensure that the `--root-ca-file` argument is set as appropriate**
   - **Scannable?**: **Yes**
   - **How?**
     - Similar to the previous requirement, the `--root-ca-file` flag is configured in the Controller Manager static pod manifest.
     - Qualys can scan the node filesystem to verify that the flag is set correctly and that the CA bundle file exists at the specified path.

#### 5. **Ensure that the `--bind-address` argument is set to `127.0.0.1`**
   - **Scannable?**: **Yes**
   - **How?**
     - The `--bind-address` flag is also part of the Controller Manager static pod manifest.
     - Qualys can scan the node filesystem to ensure that the flag is set to `127.0.0.1`.
     - Additionally, you can use network scanning tools within Qualys to verify that the metrics endpoint is not exposed externally.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è How to Implement Scanning in Qualys

#### Option A: Use Qualys Compliance Module
1. **Create Custom Policies**:
   - For each requirement, create a custom compliance rule in Qualys.
   - Example for `--use-service-account-credentials`:
     ```plaintext
     Title: Ensure --use-service-account-credentials is set to true
     Description: Verify that the Controller Manager uses dedicated service account credentials.
     Test Type: File Content Search
     Path: /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml
     Search Pattern: --use-service-account-credentials=true
     Result: Fail if pattern not found
     ```

2. **Assign Policies to Nodes**:
   - Assign the policies to the OpenShift control plane nodes where the Controller Manager runs.

3. **Run Compliance Scans**:
   - Run scans to detect misconfigurations.

#### Option B: Integrate with OpenShift Compliance Operator
1. **Use OpenShift Compliance Operator**:
   - Configure the Compliance Operator to scan for these requirements using SCAP profiles or custom checks.
   - Export the results in SCAP or CSV format.

2. **Import Results into Qualys**:
   - Use Qualys APIs or manual uploads to import the Compliance Operator results into Qualys.
   - Aggregate them with other vulnerability and compliance data.

#### Option C: Custom Scripts + Qualys Integration
1. **Write Custom Scripts**:
   - Create scripts to query the Kubernetes API or scan the filesystem for the required configurations.
   - Example script:
     ```bash
     # Check --use-service-account-credentials
     grep '--use-service-account-credentials=true' /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml
     ```

2. **Integrate with Qualys**:
   - Use Qualys API to upload the results of your custom scripts.
   - Create custom dashboards in Qualys to display the findings.

| `--root-ca-file` | Yes | Filesystem scan for static pod manifest |
| `--bind-address` | Yes | Filesystem scan for static pod manifest + network scan |

---

### üèÅ Final Recommendation

To ensure these requirements are scanned effectively:

1. **Use Qualys Compliance Module**:
   - Create custom policies for each requirement.
   - Scan the filesystem of control plane nodes.

2. **Leverage OpenShift Compliance Operator**:
   - Extend existing SCAP profiles or create custom ones for these requirements.
   - Export results and import them into Qualys.

3. **Combine Tools**:
   - Use Qualys for general compliance and vulnerability scanning.
   - Use OpenShift Compliance Operator for Kubernetes-specific checks.
   - Integrate both tools to get a comprehensive view of your cluster's security posture.
