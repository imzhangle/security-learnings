Yes, **OpenShift 4.x** includes many of the hardening capabilities out-of-the-box, but they are **not always enabled by default** for maximum flexibility. You must configure and enable them explicitly based on your security requirements.

Let’s break it down:

---

## ✅ OpenShift Versions Supporting These Hardening Features

| Feature | Available Since | Notes |
|--------|------------------|-------|
| IngressController CRD (`operator.openshift.io/v1`) | OpenShift 4.0+ | Full customization of ingress routers |
| TLS Security Profile (custom ciphers, TLS versions) | OpenShift 4.3+ | `tlsSecurityProfile` field added |
| Source CIDR restrictions (IP Whitelisting) | OpenShift 4.2+ | `routeAdmission.sourceCIDRs` |
| Disable HTTP (non-TLS routes) | OpenShift 4.2+ | `routeAdmission.disableHTTP` |
| Route Admission Policy Types | OpenShift 4.0+ | e.g., restrict `insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy` |
| Access Logging for Ingress | OpenShift 4.5+ | Configurable via `.spec.logging.access.enabled` |
| Multiple IngressControllers | OpenShift 4.0+ | Support for multiple ingress deployments |

---

## 🛡️ What Is Not Enabled by Default?

Even though the features exist, **security hardening is not fully enabled by default**, due to backward compatibility and usability reasons. Here's what you typically need to **manually configure**:

| Hardening Feature | Default in OpenShift? | Action Required |
|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Enforce HTTPS/TLS everywhere | ❌ No | Must configure TLS termination |
| Disable cleartext HTTP | ❌ No | Enable `disableHTTP: true` |
| IP whitelisting (source CIDR) | ❌ No | Configure `sourceCIDRs` |
| Strong TLS settings | ⚠️ Partial | Use `tlsSecurityProfile: Custom` |
| Access logging | ❌ No | Enable logging manually |
| Rate limiting | ❌ No | Requires Service Mesh or external tools |
| WAF integration | ❌ No | External tooling needed |
| Separate IngressControllers | ✅ Yes | Optional, needs config |
| OAuth/Authentication offloading | ✅ Yes | Configurable via OAuth and OIDC providers |

## 🔒 OpenShift Security Profiles & Compliance

Red Hat provides compliance profiles and guidance:

- **OpenShift CIS Benchmark**: Follows Center for Internet Security (CIS) standards.
- **FIPS support**: Available in OpenShift 4.6+
- **SCAP scanning**: For government and enterprise compliance
- **FedRAMP, NIST, PCI-DSS**: Supported through policies and hardened configurations

You can use **Compliance Operator** to apply and audit these controls across the cluster.

## 📦 Tools That Help with Ingress Hardening in OpenShift

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **OpenShift Service Mesh / Istio** | Advanced routing, mTLS, rate limiting |
| **OpenShift Pipelines / GitOps** | Automate deployment of secure Ingress configs |
| **OpenShift Logging** | Monitor access logs from HAProxy pods |
| **Prometheus + Grafana** | Monitor traffic patterns and detect anomalies |
| **NetworkPolicy / OVN-Kubernetes** | Restrict network access at lower layers |
| **Vault / cert-manager** | Automate certificate management |

## 🧪 Example: Enabling TLS Hardening in OpenShift 4.10+

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: IngressController
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: openshift-ingress-operator
spec:
  tlsSecurityProfile:
    type: Custom
    cipherSuites:
      - ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
      - ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
      - ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305
      - ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305
    minTLSVersion: VersionTLS12
  routeAdmission:
    disableHTTP: true
    sourceCIDRs:
      - 192.168.100.0/24
  logging:
    access:
      enabled: true
```

This config would be applied using `oc apply` or via GitOps pipelines.

## 🔄 Summary

| OpenShift Version | Supports Ingress Hardening Features |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|
| OpenShift 4.0–4.2 | Basic IngressController support |
| OpenShift 4.3–4.5 | TLS custom profiles, source CIDR |
| OpenShift 4.6–4.8 | Enhanced logging, FIPS, SCAP |
| OpenShift 4.9+ | Improved mesh integration, advanced policy |

> 🔐 **Conclusion**: OpenShift has supported most of these hardening options since 4.2+, but they must be explicitly configured. Starting with OpenShift 4.5+, more granular control over TLS, logging, and admission policies is available.
